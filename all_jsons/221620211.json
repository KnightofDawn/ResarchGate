Convolutional Networks.", "authors": {"1": "Viren Jain", "2": "Hyunjune Sebastian Seung"}, "abstract": "We present an approach to low-level vision that combines two main ideas: the use of convolutional networks as an image processing architecture and an unsu- pervised learning procedure that synthesizes training samples from specific noise models. We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of natural image denoising. Using a test set with a hundred natural images, we find that con- volutional networks provide comparable and in some cases superior performance to state of the art wavelet and Markov random field (MRF) methods. Moreover, we find that a convolutional network offers similar performance in the blind de- noising setting as compared to other techniques in the non-blind setting. We also show how convolutional networks are mathematically related to MRF approaches by presenting a mean field theory for an MRF specially designed for image denois- ing. Although these approaches are related, convolutional networks avoid compu- tational difficulties in MRF approaches that arise from probabilistic learning and inference. This makes it possible to learn image processing architectures that have a high degree of representational power (we train models with over 15,000 param- eters), but whose computational expense is significantly less than that associated with inference in MRF approaches with even hundreds of parameters."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4260123_Learning_Gaussian_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Low-Level_Vision", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110837_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Restoration_with_Convolutional_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792722_Sparse_feature_learning_for_deep_belief_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364240_Fields_of_Experts_A_Framework_for_Learning_Image_Priors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5606886_Image_denoising_using_scale_mixtures_of_Gaussians_in_the_wavelet_domain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3328006_Toward_automatic_phenotyping_of_developing_embryos_from_videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618202_Products_of_Edge-perts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618460_Statistical_Modeling_of_Images_with_Fields_of_Gaussian_Scale_Mixtures", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics_EECS_Department_University_of_California_Berkeley", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41224942_Filters_Random_Fields_and_Maximum_Entropy_FRAME_Towards_a_Unified_Theory_for_Texture_Modeling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224716244_What_makes_a_good_model_of_natural_images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2328917_Learning_Continuous_Attractors_in_Recurrent_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245578967_Back-Propagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip-code_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2869101_Discriminative_Fields_for_Modeling_Spatial_Dependencies_in_Natural_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228813946_Learning_in_markov_random_fields_An_empirical_study", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225716342_A_Comparative_Study_of_Energy_Minimization_Methods_for_Markov_Random_Fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234785569_High-order_markov_random_fields_for_low-level_vision", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082357_Multiscale_conditional_random_fields_for_image_labeling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744514_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks"]}
