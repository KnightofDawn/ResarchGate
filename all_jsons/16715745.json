cat area 17", "authors": {"1": "W H Mullikin", "3": "L A Palmer", "2": "J P Jones"}, "abstract": "Quantitative, high-resolution static receptive-field plots (response planes) in cat area 17 revealed simple cells whose receptive fields were composed of four to six excitatory regions alternating in space with up to seven inhibitory regions. The size, shape, and spacing of the excitatory regions within these receptive fields were highly regular, giving the receptive field a periodic appearance in space. We call these periodic simple cells. A periodic simple cell's response to moving stimuli could, in general, be anticipated from the detailed spatiotemporal map of excitatory and inhibitory regions provided by response planes. This observation suggests that periodic simple cells, like the more common simple cells composed of one to three excitatory regions, sum spatially distributed inputs in a roughly linear manner. Based on a quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and time course of response of single excitatory regions within periodic receptive fields, as described in the previous paper, we characterized periodic simple cells as either X-like or Y-like. Furthermore, we found that periodic simple cells classified as X-like gave a more sustained response to standing contrast and had significantly smaller excitatory regions than those cells classified as Y-like. Periodic simple cells were found in layer III and at the border between layers III and IVab. It is suggested that these cells, which reside outside the primary zone of geniculate termination and include both X-like and Y-like types, may be constructed hierarchically from the convergence of lower order simple cells. In the spatial-frequency domain, periodic simple receptive fields were predicted to have bandwidths at half-maximum ranging from 0.80 to 1.4 octaves. By comparison, the predicted bandwidths of cells composed of two or three excitatory regions ranged from 1.6 to 4.3 octaves. Thus as additional excitatory regions are added to the receptive fields of simple cells, their bandwidth narrows in the spatial-frequency domain."}, "references": []}
