This is accomplished by a new approach to generating ``in-face\" directions at each iteration, as well as through new choice rules for selecting between in-face and ``regular\" Frank-Wolfe steps. Our framework for generating in-face directions generalizes the notion of away-steps introduced by Wolfe. In particular, the in-face directions always keep the next iterate within the minimal face containing the current iterate. We present computational guarantees for the new method that trade off efficiency in computing near-optimal solutions with upper bounds on the dimension of minimal faces of iterates. We apply the new method to the matrix completion problem, where low-dimensional faces correspond to low-rank matrices. We present computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodological approach at producing nearly-optimal solutions of very low rank. On both artificial and real datasets, we demonstrate significant speed-ups in computing very low-rank nearly-optimal solutions as compared to either the Frank-Wolfe method or its traditional away-step variant."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220133672_A_Singular_Value_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Matrix_Completion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224133702_Matrix_Completion_With_Noise", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227101649_Exact_Matrix_Completion_via_Convex_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224132846_The_Power_of_Convex_Relaxation_Near-Optimal_Matrix_Completion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226954728_Complexity_of_quantifier_elimination_in_the_theory_of_algebraically_closed_fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229760450_An_Algorithm_for_Quadratic_Programming", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227292141_Some_comments_on_Wolfe's_'away_step'", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268204259_Conditional_gradient_algorithms_for_machine_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235432309_Conditional_Gradient_Algorithms_for_Norm-Regularized_Smooth_ConvexOptimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Second_Edition_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259758847_Revisiting_Frank-Wolfe_Projection-Free_Sparse_Convex_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345200_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Nuclear_Norm_Regularized_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346122_An_accelerated_gradient_method_for_trace_norm_minimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259483501_An_Affine_Invariant_Linear_Convergence_Analysis_for_Frank-Wolfe_Algorithms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256926002_The_Complexity_of_Large-scale_Convex_Programming_under_a_Linear_Optimization_Oracle", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45850820_Fixed_Point_and_Bregman_Iterative_Methods_for_Matrix_Rank_Minimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51107750_Spectral_Regularization_Algorithms_for_Learning_Large_Incomplete_Matrices", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220481552_Low-Rank_Optimization_with_Trace_Norm_Penalty", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261253432_Scalable_Robust_Matrix_Recovery_Frank-Wolfe_Meets_Proximal_Methods", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280104918_On_the_von_Neumann_and_Frank-Wolfe_Algorithms_with_Away_Steps", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261879711_Forward_-_Backward_Greedy_Algorithms_for_Atomic_Norm_Regularization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1896344_Guaranteed_Minimum-Rank_Solutions_of_Linear_Matrix_Equations_via_Nuclear_Norm_Minimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345756_Fast_maximum_margin_matrix_factorization_for_collaborative_prediction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260365721_On_accelerated_proximal_gradient_methods_for_convex-concave_optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266512794_Convergence_Theory_in_Nonlinear_Programming"]}
