Each channel has the following features: (1) variable gain (70-94 dB), (2) four high pass Bessel filter poles (f(-3 dB)=445 Hz), (3) five low pass Bessel filter poles (f(-3 dB)=6.6 kHz), and (4) differential amplification with a user selectable reference channel to reject common mode background biological noise. Processed signals are time division multiplexed and sampled by an on-board 12-bit analog to digital converter at up to 62.5k samples/s per channel. The board is powered by two low dropout voltage regulators which may be supplied by a single battery. The board measures 8.1 cm x 9.9 cm, weighs 50 g, and consumes up to 130 mW. Its low input-referred noise (1.0 microV(RMS)) makes it possible to process low amplitude neural signals; the board was successfully tested in vivo to process cortically derived extracellular action potentials in primates. Signals processed by this board were compared to those generated by a commercially available system and were found to be nearly identical. Background noise generated by mastication was substantially attenuated by the selectable reference circuit. The described circuit is light weight and low power and is used as a component of a wearable multichannel neural telemetry system."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14081121_Nicolelis_MAL_Ghazanfar_AA_Faggin_BM_Votaw_S_Oliveira_LMO_Reconstructing_the_engram_simultaneous_multisite_may_single_neuron_recordings_Neuron_18_529-537", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8891520_A_multichannel_telemetry_system_for_single_unit_neural_recordings", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11481542_Taste-specific_neuronal_ensembles_in_the_gustatory_cortex_of_awake_rats", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12697935_Spatial_and_nonspatial_information_in_the_dorsal_hippocampus", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12228986_Wessberg_J_et_al_Real-time_prediction_of_hand_trajectory_by_ensembles_of_cortical_neurons_in_primates_Nature_408_361-365", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11836949_Ohl_FW_Scheich_H_Freeman_WJ_Change_in_pattern_of_ongoing_cortical_activity_with_auditory_category_learning_Nature_412_733-736", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10831287_Two_multichannel_integrated_circuits_for_neural_recording_and_signal_processing"]}
