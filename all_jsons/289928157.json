Venkatesh Babu"}, "abstract": "Traditional architectures for solving computer vision problems and the degree of success they enjoyed have been heavily reliant on hand-crafted features. However, of late, deep learning techniques have offered a compelling alternative \u2013 that of automatically learning problem-specific features. With this new paradigm, every problem in computer vision is now being re-examined from a deep learning perspective. Therefore, it has become important to understand what kind of deep networks are suitable for a given problem. Although general surveys of this fast-moving paradigm (i.e., deep-networks) exist, a survey specific to computer vision is missing. We specifically consider one form of deep networks widely used in computer vision \u2013 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We start with \u201cAlexNet\u201d as our base CNN and then examine the broad variations proposed over time to suit different applications. We hope that our recipe-style survey will serve as a guide, particularly for novice practitioners intending to use deep-learning techniques for computer vision."}, "references":
