Our work builds on static image captioning systems with RNN based language models and extends this framework to videos utilizing both static image features and video-specific features. In addition, we study the usefulness of visual content classifiers as a source of additional information for caption generation. With experimental results we show that utilizing keyframe based features, dense trajectory video features and content classifier outputs together gives better performance than any one of them individually.
