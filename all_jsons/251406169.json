In particular, Gordon et al. present a no- -regret algorithm for several different classes of trans- formations (4). In this paper, we instantiate the algorithm for the class of linear transformations using a variety of optimization techniques and give experimental results on several games including Indian poker, a sim- ple but substantially large-scale variant of poker. Our results show that both no-external-regret and no-linear-regret algorithms can achieve bet- ter regret performances than what the current theory guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work empirically demonstrating the benefits of a no- -regret algorithm for general convex games where is stronger than external."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620272_No-regret_Algorithms_for_Online_Convex_Programs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695781_Learning_correlated_equilibria_in_games_with_compact_sets_of_strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344757_No-regret_learning_in_convex_games", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2885544_Online_Convex_Programming_and_Generalized_Infinitesimal_Gradient_Ascent", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497458_A_General_Class_of_No-Regret_Learning_Algorithms_and_Game-Theoretic_Equilibria", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225814506_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Online_Decision_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228989795_Computationally_efficient_coordination_in_game_trees"]}
