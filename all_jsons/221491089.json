Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) articial neural networks are capable to outperform previous recurrent networks on many tasks ranging from grammar recognition to speech [4] and,robot control [5]. Together with our psycho-computational model they are supposed to recognize phonetic features in a way similar to humans,learning to understand their rst language."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2880936_Biologically_Plausible_Speech_Recognition_with_LSTM_Neural_Nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229771050_Child_Language_Aphasia_and_Phonological_Universal", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2631538_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Learns_Context_Free_and_Context_Sensitive_Languages", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221491666_Pronunciation_modeling_for_large_vocabulary_conversational_speech_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242382936_INDEPENDENT_AUTOMATIC_SEGMENTATION_OF_SPEECH_BY_PRONUNCIATION_MODELING", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221483186_Generation_of_pronunciation_rule_sets_for_automatic_segmentation_of_American_English_and_Japanese", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221484710_German_Regional_Variants_-_A_Problem_for_Automatic_Speech_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2386681_Regional_Pronunciation_Variants_for_Automatic_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230876214_Knowledge_of_Language_Its_Nature_Origin_and_Use_Praeger_New_York", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11404976_Finding_Downbeats_with_a_Relaxation_Oscillator", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247435675_RULE-BASED_CATEGORIAL_ANALYSIS_OF_UNPROMPTED_SPEECH_-_A_CROSS-LANGUAGE_STUDY", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230875924_Lectures_on_Government_and_Binding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243676894_Learning_How_to_Mean_Explorations_in_the_Development_of_Language_Elsevier_New_YorkNY", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3907031_Meta-learning_with_backpropagation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231888552_Transitional_phenomena_in_early_language_acquistion"]}
