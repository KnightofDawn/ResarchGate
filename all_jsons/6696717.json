These resources will be of increasing value for understanding the brain. Developing a database system to integrate these disparate resources is necessary to make full use of these resources. This study proposes a base database system termed XooNIps that utilizes the content management system called XOOPS. XooNIps is designed for developing databases in different research fields through customization of the option menu. In a XooNIps-based database, digital resources are stored according to their respective categories, e.g., research articles, experimental data, mathematical models, stimulations, each associated with their related metadata. Several types of user authorization are supported for secure operations. In addition to the directory and keyword searches within a certain database, XooNIps searches simultaneously across other XooNIps-based databases on the Internet. Reviewing systems for user registration and for data submission are incorporated to impose quality control. Furthermore, XOOPS modules containing news, forums schedules, blogs and other information can be combined to enhance XooNIps functionality. These features provide better scalability, extensibility, and customizability to the general neuroinformatics community. The application of this system to data, models, and other information related to human pupils is described here."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256282805_A_simulation_model_of_the_human_pupil_light_reflex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226252638_Estimation_of_autonomic_nervous_activity_using_the_inverse_dynamic_model_of_the_pupil_muscle_plant", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7803349_Action_of_biologically_active_peptide_on_monkey_iris_sphincter_and_dilator_muscles", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9004062_Visiome_Neuroinformatics_research_in_vision_project", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11493817_Effect_of_pituitary_adenylate_cyclase-activating_peptide_on_isolated_rabbit_iris_sphincter_and_dilator_muscles", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226104810_Systems_model_for_pupil_size_effect", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256283034_Neuronal_population_model_for_the_pupil-size_effect", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13494343_Neural_network_mosaic_model_for_pupillary_responses_to_spatial_stimuli", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242991358_Simulation_of_a_biomechanical_model_of_the_human_pupil", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10943550_Mechanical_properties_of_the_rabbit_iris_smooth_muscles", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27686593_The_Santa_Fe_Convention_of_the_Open_Archives_Initiative", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16568910_A_systems_model_for_the_pupil_size_effect_-_I_Transient_data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16071767_A_model_for_nonlinear_stochastic_behavior_of_the_pupil", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37991683_DSpace_An_Open_Source_Dynamic_Digital_Repository", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9056999_Effect_of_somatostatin_and_galanin_on_isolated_rabbit_iris_sphincter_and_dilator_muscles"]}
