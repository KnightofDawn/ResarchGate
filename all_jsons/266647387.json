However, there is still a gap from real application when selecting a suitable cover image for a given payload. This paper tries to minimize this gap by presenting a novel cover selection scheme which measures image embedding suitability under user constraints. Experiments show that the acquired empirical security exceeds the expectation."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224226888_Minimizing_Additive_Distortion_in_Steganography_Using_Syndrome-Trellis_Codes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233761354_Ensemble_Classifiers_for_Steganalysis_of_Digital_Media", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220177204_Edge_Adaptive_Image_Steganography_Based_on_LSB_Matching_Revisited", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40653276_Steganalysis_by_Subtractive_Pixel_Adjacency_Matrix", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224175907_Gibbs_Construction_in_Steganography", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233761465_Designing_Steganographic_Distortion_Using_Directional_Filters"]}
