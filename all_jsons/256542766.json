The time he come to consolation to doctor, it may be late and he may be more critical. Lets call this situation \u2018pre-consultation urgent help needed\u2019. Many time it happen that person coming to hospital is not well and need urgent attention but he is pointed to reception counter to queue in for consultation. So, some mechanism is needed to detect that person coming to hospital need urgent help or not. Gait is considered best for this situation where person might not be able to come to machine to give biometric information.  This paper discuss gait recognition and its suitability in the case of \u2018pre-consultation urgent help\u2019 and implement this functionality. Also with the gait, it could be detected whether a person has homeostasis or not. Feature extraction was performed on each image frame of live video and SVM is used to classify the gait detected from the person live image frame. The system use MS Kinect as hardware and is very cost effective. Experimental results show 96% recognition accuracy.
