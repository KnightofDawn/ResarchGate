We employed an artificial synapse composed of multiple OxRAM cells connected in parallel, thereby providing synaptic efficacies. Electrical characterization results show that the proposed HfO2-based OxRAM technology offers good electrical properties in terms of endurance ( cycles), speed (<10 ns), and low energy (<10 pJ), and thus being well suited for neuromorphic applications. A device physical model is developed in order to study the variability of the resistance as a function of the stochastic position of oxygen vacancies in 3-D. Finally, the proposed binary OxRAM synapse has been used for CNN system-level simulations. High accuracy (recognition rate > 98%) is demonstrated for a complex visual pattern recognition application. We demonstrated that the resistance variability and the reduced memory window of the OxRAM cells when operated at extremely low programming conditions (<10 pJ per switching event) have a small impact on the performances of proposed OxRAM-based CNN (recognition rate 94%)."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241634307_Energy_efficient_programming_of_nanoelectronic_synaptic_devices_for_large-scale_implementation_of_associative_and_temporal_sequence_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269328618_Probabilistic_neuromorphic_system_using_binary_phase-change_memory_PCM_synapses_Detailed_power_consumption_analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258337503_Stochastic_learning_in_oxide_binary_synaptic_device_for_neuromorphic_computing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220860992_Best_Practices_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Visual_Document_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264087033_A_Compact_Model_of_Program_Window_in_HfOx_RRAM_Devices_for_Conductive_Filament_Characteristics_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254055998_On_the_Switching_Parameter_Variation_of_Metal-Oxide_RRAM-Part_I_Physical_Modeling_and_Simulation_Methodology", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270826897_A_compound_memristive_synapse_model_for_statistical_learning_through_STDP_in_spiking_neural_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271544718_Shared_memristance_restoring_circuit_for_memristor-based_Cellular_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271494532_Design_exploration_methodology_for_memristor-based_spiking_neuromorphic_architectures_with_the_Xnet_event-driven_simulator", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257019759_Balancing_SETRESET_Pulse_for_Endurance_in_1T1R_Bipolar_RRAM", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256377858_Synaptic_electronics_Materials_devices_and_applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271463065_197_A_16Gb_ReRAM_with_200MBs_write_and_1GBs_read_in_27nm_technology", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261196833_Impact_of_PCM_resistance-drift_in_neuromorphic_systems_and_drift-mitigation_strategy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257954219_Quantum-size_effects_in_hafnium-oxide_resistive_switching", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232709746_Metal-oxide_RRAM", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257019768_Intrinsic_switching_variability_in_HfO_2_RRAM", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275886006_Variability-tolerant_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Pattern_Recognition_applications_based_on_OxRAM_synapses"]}
