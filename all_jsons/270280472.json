However, the combination of large number of examples and high dimensional vectors necessitates dimensionality reduction, in order to reduce its storage and CPU costs to a reasonable range. In spite of the popularity of various feature compression methods, this paper argues that feature selection is a better choice than feature compression. We show that strong multicollinearity among feature dimensions may not exist, which undermines feature compression\u2019s effectiveness and renders feature selection a natural choice. We also show that many dimensions are noise and throwing them away is helpful for classification. We propose a supervised mutual information (MI) based importance sorting algorithm to choose features. Combining with 1-bit quantization, MI feature selection has achieved both higher accuracy and less computational cost than feature compression methods such as product quantization and BPBC.
