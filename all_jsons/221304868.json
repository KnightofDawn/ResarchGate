Xing"}, "abstract": "  ABSTRACT Building visual recognition models that adapt across different do- mains is a challenging task for computer vision. While feature-learning machines in the form of hierarchial feed-forward models (e.g., convolutional neural net- works) showed promise in this direction, they are still difficult to train especially when few training examples are available. In this paper, we present a framework for training hierarchical feed-forward models for visual recognition, using trans- fer learning from pseudo tasks. These pseudo tasks are automatically constructed from data without supervision and comprise a set of simple pattern-matching op- erations. We show that these pseudo tasks induce an informative inverse-Wishart prior on the functional behavior of the network, offering an effective way to in- corporate useful prior knowledge into the network training. In addition to being extremely simple to implement, and adaptable across different domains with little or no extra tuning, our approach achieves promising results on challenging visual recognition tasks, including object recognition, gender recognition, and ethnicity recognition.
