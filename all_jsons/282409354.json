Rude", "3": "Peter Adam Beling", "2": "Stephen Adams"}, "abstract": "  ABSTRACT Algorithms for automated recognition of human activities are crucial for supporting the next generation of process measures in manufacturing. While there is active research underway for many sensor systems and algorithms they will need to be tested in real-world conditions in order to mature and become robust or generalized enough for broad deployment in industry. In this paper we present a case study and dataset from a real-world setting along with three performance measures for six common classifiers. The intent is to provide a dataset and baseline performance level metrics so that others may compare their activity recognition algorithms to a common standard.
