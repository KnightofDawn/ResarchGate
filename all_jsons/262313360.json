The Emotion Recognition In The Wild Challenge and Workshop (EmotiW) 2013 Grand Challenge consists of an audio-video based emotion classification challenges, which mimics real-world conditions. Traditionally, emotion recognition has been performed on laboratory controlled data. While undoubtedly worthwhile at the time, such laboratory controlled data poorly represents the environment and conditions faced in real-world situations. The goal of this Grand Challenge is to define a common platform for evaluation of emotion recognition methods in real-world conditions. The database in the 2013 challenge is the Acted Facial Expression in the Wild (AFEW), which has been collected from movies showing close-to-real-world conditions.
