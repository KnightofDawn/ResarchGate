Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has gained interest because of its unique electrochemical characteristics and its excellent intrinsic electrical conductivity. However, the long-term stability of the PEDOT film, especially for chronic neural applications, is unclear. In this manuscript, we report for the first time the use of highly stable PEDOT doped with tetrafluoroborate (TFB) for long-term neural recordings. We show that PEDOT-TFB coated microelectrodes on average register more units compared to control gold microelectrodes for at least first four weeks post implantation. We collected the in vivo impedance data over a wide frequency spectrum and developed an equivalent circuit model which helped us determine certain parameters to distinguish between PEDOT-TFB microelectrodes with and without long-term activity. Our findings suggest that PEDOT-TFB is a chronically stable coating for neural recording microelectrodes. As such, PEDOT-TFB could facilitate chronic recordings with ultra-small and high-density neural arrays.
