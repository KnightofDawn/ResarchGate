Images have a large size which allows embedding secret messages of large size, so they are a good medium for digital steganography. The main goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of hidden messages in digital media. In this paper, we propose a steganalysis method based on color feature correlation and machine learning classification. Fusing features with features obtained from color-rich models allows to increase the detectability of hidden messages in the color images. Our novel proposition uses the correlation between different channels of color images. Features are extracted from the channel correlation and co-occurrence correlation. In this work, all stego images are created with a range of different payload sizes using two steganography S-UNIWARD and WOW algorithms. To validate the proposed method, his efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with color rich model steganalysis."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234805851_Steganography_in_Digital_Media_Principles_Algorithms_and_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3864018_Steganalysis_of_LSB_encoding_in_color_images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722189_Detecting_Low_Embedding_Rates", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221011147_Resampling_and_the_detection_of_LSB_matching_in_color_bitmaps", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2554462_Steganalysis_of_Additive_Noise_Modelable_Information_Hiding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225302733_Steganalysis_Using_Color_Model_Conversion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221011180_Steganalysis_using_color_wavelet_statistics_and_one-class_support_vector_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269295408_Steganalysis_in_Technicolor_Boosting_WS_detection_of_stego_images_from_CFA-interpolated_covers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221011162_On_estimation_of_secret_message_length_in_LSB_steganography_in_spatial_domain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254058999_Rich_Models_for_Steganalysis_of_Digital_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245691667_Color_Imaging_Array-US_Patent_3", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221122418_New_color_filter_arrays_of_high_light_sensitivity_and_high_demosaicking_performance", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243782877_Theory_of_Algebraic_Invariants", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221260077_A_Fast_Matching_Method_for_Color_Uncalibrated_Images_Using_Differential_Invariants", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233761354_Ensemble_Classifiers_for_Steganalysis_of_Digital_Media", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110652_High_quality_image_reconstruction_from_RAW_and_JPEG_image_pair", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220998815_The_Dresden_Image_Database_for_Benchmarking_Digital_Image_Forensics", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259639875_Universal_Distortion_Function_for_Steganography_in_an_Arbitrary_Domain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233761465_Designing_Steganographic_Distortion_Using_Directional_Filters", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240613962_Digital_Image_Steganography_Using_Universal_Distortion"]}
