Typically, HPC systems are dynamic with multiple jobs coming and leaving in an unpredictable fashion, sharing simultaneously the system interconnection network. In such environment contention for network resources is causing random stalls in the progress of application execution degrading application and system performance overall. Eliminating job interactions in their neighborhoods is key for guaranteeing performance predictability of applications. In this paper we are proposing the concept of quiet neighborhoods that significantly reduce job interactions. Quiet neighborhoods are created by the system resource manager in two phases. First, multiple virtual network blocks are defined on the top of the physical network resources based on typical workload distributions. Second, newly arriving jobs are allocated in these virtual blocks based on their size."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140574_Design_of_a_Scalable_InfiniBand_Topology_Service_to_Enable_Network-Topology-Aware_Placement_of_Processes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2962349_Interconnection_Networks_Architectural_Challenges_for_Utility_Computing_Data_Centers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4124035_Impact_of_Job_Mix_on_Optimizations_for_Space_Sharing_Schedulers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261272242_Measuring_interference_between_live_datacenter_applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262292331_Paragon_QoS-Aware_Scheduling_for_Heterogeneous_Datacenters", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262271809_There_goes_the_neighborhood_Performance_degradation_due_to_nearby_jobs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260584713_On_the_trade-off_of_mixing_scientific_applications_on_capacity_high-performance_computing_systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221475403_Effects_of_Topology-Aware_Allocation_Policies_on_Scheduling_Performance", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277298441_A_Minimal_Fragmentation_Algorithm_for_Task_Allocation_in_Mesh-Connected_Multicomputers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221016089_The_Networks_of_the_Connection_Machine_CM-5", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220951502_k_-ary_n_-trees_High_Performance_Networks_for_Massively_Parallel_Architectures", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220948519_On_generalized_fat_trees", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267798236_Comprehensive_Workload_Analysis_and_Modeling_of_a_Petascale_Supercomputer", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224257195_Efficient_and_Contention-Free_Virtualisation_of_Fat-Trees", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221392315_Effects_of_Job_and_Task_Placement_on_Parallel_Scientific_Applications_Performance", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225298312_Effective_Quality-of-Service_Policy_for_Capacity_High-Performance_Computing_Systems"]}
