However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonalcovariance Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data. Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT to date. 1  "}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221404645_Statistical_Modeling_in_Continuous_Speech_Recognition_CSR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7956203_How_to_Pretend_That_Correlated_Variables_Are_Independent_by_Using_Difference_Observations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362351_Modeling_Pixel_Means_and_Covariances_Using_Factorized_Third-Order_Boltzmann_Machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320634_Factored_3-Way_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_For_Modeling_Natural_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321165_Continuous_speech_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2722925_An_Application_of_Recurrent_Nets_to_Phone_Probability_Estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221489416_Towards_better_understanding_of_the_model_implied_by_the_use_of_dynamic_features_in_HMMs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224371235_Speech_Recognition_Using_Augmented_Conditional_Random_Fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224640903_Large_Margin_Gaussian_Mixture_Modeling_for_Phonetic_Classification_and_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228871422_Deep_Belief_Networks_for_phone_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3457577_Minimum_phone_error_training_of_precision_matrix_models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4249197_Use_of_Differential_Cepstra_as_Acoustic_Features_in_Hidden_Trajectory_Modeling_for_Phonetic_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3175691_Speaker-independent_phone_recognition_using_hidden_Markov_models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620477_3D_Object_Recognition_with_Deep_Belief_Nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221485086_Combining_phonetic_attributes_using_conditional_random_fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238727850_CUDAMat_a_CUDA-based_matrix_class_for_Python", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224096916_An_exploration_of_large_vocabulary_tools_for_small_vocabulary_phonetic_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221489340_Heterogeneous_measurements_and_multiple_classifiers_for_speech_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239666609_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks_PhD_thesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223927652_Connectionist_learning_of_belief_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3746672_Improved_phone_recognition_using_Bayesian_triphone_models"]}
