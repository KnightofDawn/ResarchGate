In this article a new multiplication free algorithm for approximate computation of the DFT is introduced. All multiplications $(a\\times b)$ in DFT are replaced by an operator which computes $sign(a\\times b)(|a|+|b|)$. The new transform is especially useful when the signal processing algorithm requires correlations. Ambiguity function in radar signal processing requires high number of multiplications to compute the correlations. This new additive operator is used to decrease the number of multiplications. Simulation examples involving passive radars are presented.
