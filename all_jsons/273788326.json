User control with Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exacerbates these problems through especially noisy and even erratic low-dimensional motion commands due to the difficulty in decoding neural activity. We introduce a general framework to address these challenges through a combination of Machine Vision, User Intent Inference, and Human-Robot Autonomy Control Arbitration. Adjustable levels of assistance allow the system to balance the operator's capabilities and feelings of comfort and control while compensating for a task's difficulty. We present experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvement using the shared-control assistance framework on adapted rehabilitation benchmarks with two subjects implanted with intracortical brain-computer interfaces controlling a high degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator as a prosthetic. Our results further indicate shared assistance mitigates perceived user difficulty and even enables successful performance on previously infeasible tasks. We showcase the extensibility of our architecture with applications to quality-of-life tasks such as opening a door with a BCI, pouring liquids from a container with a dual-joystick game controller, and manipulation in dense clutter with a 6-DoF motion controller.
