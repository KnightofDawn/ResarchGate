Over-Complete Sparse Coding Using a Mixture Model", "authors": {"1": "Jianchao Yang", "3": "Thomas S. Huang", "2": "Kai Yu"}, "abstract": "Sparse coding of sensory data has recently attracted notable attention in research of learning useful features from the unlabeled data. Empirical studies show that mapping the data into a signicantly higher- dimensional space with sparse coding can lead to superior classication performance. However, computationally it is challenging to learn a set of highly over-complete dictionary bases and to encode the test data with the learned bases. In this paper, we describe a mixture sparse coding model that can produce high-dimensional sparse representations very eciently. Besides the computational advantage, the model eectively encourages data that are similar to each other to enjoy similar sparse representations. What's more, the proposed model can be regarded as an approximation to the recently proposed local coordinate coding (LCC), which states that sparse coding can approximately learn the nonlinear manifold of the sensory data in a locally linear manner. Therefore, the feature learned by the mixture sparse coding model works pretty well with linear classiers. We apply the proposed model to PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2009 datasets for the classication task, both achieving state- of-the-art performances."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14562158_Olshausen_BA_Field_DJ_Emergence_of_simple-cell_receptive_field_properties_by_learning_a_sparse_code_for_natural_images_Nature_381_607-609", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619595_Differentiable_Sparse_Coding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224092448_Learning_With_-Graph_for_Image_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46146267_Compressive_Sensing_for_Background_Subtraction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224401082_Demo_Robust_face_recognition_via_sparse_representation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364080_Linear_spatial_pyramid_matching_using_sparse_coding_for_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364029_Supervised_translation-invariant_sparse_coding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620168_Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms_NIPS", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45865402_Online_Learning_for_Matrix_Factorization_and_Sparse_Coding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1775282_Supervised_Dictionary_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224579211_Learning_invariant_features_through_topographic_filter_maps", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224136112_Hierarchical_Gaussianization_for_Image_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364427_Locality-constrained_Linear_Coding_for_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792722_Sparse_feature_learning_for_deep_belief_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_Challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224309574_Robust_Face_Recognition_via_Sparse_Representation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation_IEEE_Trans_Signal_Processing_54_4311-4322", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13803865_Olshausen_BA_Field_DJ_Sparse_coding_with_an_overcomplete_basis_set_a_strategy_employed_by_V1_Vision_Res_37_3311-3325", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364186_Image_super-resolution_as_sparse_representation_of_raw_image_patches", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227654274_Donoho_DL_For_Most_Large_Underdetermined_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_the_Minimal_L1-norm_Solution_Is_also_the_Sparsest_Solution_Communications_on_Pure_and_Applied_Mathematics_596_797-829", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3084564_Pattern_recognition_and_machine_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248516115_The_pascal_visual_object_classes_challenge_2006_results", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618703_Nonlinear_Learning_using_Local_Coordinate_Coding_NIPS2223-2231", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642198_Learning_object_representations_for_visual_object_class_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038912_Self-taught_learning_Transfer_learning_from_unlabeled_data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284048721_For_Most_Large_Underdetermined_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_the_Minimal_L1-norm_Solution_is_also_the_Sparsest_Solution", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283360188_Sparse_Coding_with_an_Overcomplete_Basis_Set_A_Strategy_Employed_by_V1", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280940018_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning"]}
