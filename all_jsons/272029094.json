Building upon Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs), Factored Four Way Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (FFW-CRBMs) incorporate a new label layer and four-way interactions among the neurons from the different layers. The additional layer gives the classification nodes a similar strong multiplicative effect compared to the other layers, and avoids that the classification neurons are overwhelmed by the (much larger set of) other neurons. This makes FFW-CRBMs capable of performing activity recognition, prediction and self auto evaluation of classification within one unified framework. As a second contribution, Sequential Markov chain Contrastive Divergence (SMcCD) is introduced. SMcCD modifies Contrastive Divergence to compensate for the extra complexity of FFW-CRBMs during training. Two sets of experiments one on benchmark datasets and one a robotic platform for smart companions show the effectiveness of FFW-CRBMs.  "}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270790857_Sensor-Based_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343922_Support_Vector_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345476_The_rate_adapting_poisson_RAP_model_for_information_retrieval_and_object_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272746011_A_Practical_Guide_to_Training_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Version_1", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11207765_ARTICLE_Training_Products_of_Experts_by_Minimizing_Contrastive_Divergence", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259630330_Computer_science_The_learning_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346359_Classification_using_discriminative_restricted_Boltzmann_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220398519_From_Neural_Networks_to_Deep_Learning_Zeroing_in_on_the_human_brain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41415919_LETTER_Communicated_by_Dana_Ballard_Learning_to_Represent_Spatial_Transformations_with_Factored_Higher-Order_Boltzmann_Machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233786470_Berkeley_MHAD_A_comprehensive_Multimodal_Human_Action_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345934_Restricted_Boltzmann_machines_for_collaborative_filtering", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239571798_Smolensky_P_Information_processing_in_dynamical_systems_Foundations_of_harmony_theory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744461_Learning_multilevel_distributed_representations_for_high-dimensional_sequences", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346352_Factored_conditional_restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_modeling_motion_style", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320506_Two_Distributed-State_Models_For_Generating_High-Dimensional_Time_Series", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51843928_Higher-Order_Interactions_Characterized_in_Cortical_Activity", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272623654_Libsvm"]}
