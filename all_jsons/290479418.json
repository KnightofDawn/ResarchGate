Increasing the truncation threshold and the co-occurrence order will lead to a higher-dimensional feature, which can exploit more statistical bins and capture dependencies across larger-range neighborhood, but this will suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a fast projection method to increase the statistical robustness of the higher-dimensional SRM feature while decreasing its dimensionality. The proposed projection method is applicable to co-occurrence-based steganalysis features. The detection performance and the computational complexity of the proposed method are investigated on three content-adaptive steganographic algorithms in spatial domain.
