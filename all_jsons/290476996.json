Recognition of ADLs is key element for building intelligent and pervasive environments. We propose a two-layer HMM to build a ADLs recognition model that can represent the mapping between low-level sensor data and high-level activity based on the binary sensor data. We used embedded sensor with appliances or object to get object used sequence data as well as object name, type, interaction time, and location. In the first layer, we use location data of object used sensor to predict the activity class and in the second layer object used sequence data to determine the exact activity. We perform comparison with other activity recognition models using three real datasets to validate the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model achieves significantly better recognition performance than other models.
