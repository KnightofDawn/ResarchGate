The hierarchy of the proposed object detection technique is motivated by the hierarchical learning mechanism in primate visual cortex, where each layer processes information differently. Initially, pyramid histogram of oriented gradients (PHOG) based descriptors are selected to generate shift and scale invariant descriptors of an image. PHOG based feature descriptors are then processed in multi-layered hierarchy, following feed forward models in brain's visual cortex and exploited through ensemble classification techniques. The proposed cortex-inspired ensemble based object detection (CI-EnsOD) system exploits hierarchical learning mechanism of visual cortex and it is computationally efficient compared to the existing cortex-inspired models. In addition, it reduces feature dimensionality and offers improved object detection performance. The performance of proposed technique is demonstrated using three publically available standard datasets. It is shown experimentally that the prototype selection in the proposed CI-EnsOD can be improved using k-means clustering. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed CI-EnsOD technique is more accurate and efficient than contemporary cortex-inspired object detection techniques. Finally, it is also observed that the proposed technique is capable of providing compact descriptors compared to principle component analysis and independent component analysis."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4156337_Object_recognition_with_features_inspired_by_visual_cortex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6576879_Robust_Object_Recognition_with_Cortex-Like_Mechanisms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220612580_Neurophysiology_of_shape_processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221567825_Ultra-Rapid_Scene_Categorization_with_a_Wave_of_Spikes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10710626_A_Cortical_Mechanism_for_Triggering_Top-Down_Facilitation_in_Visual_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221823636_How_Does_the_Brain_Solve_Visual_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2374982_Computational_Models_of_Object_Recognition_in_Cortex_A_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10698894_Learning_Optimized_Features_for_Hierarchical_Models_of_Invariant_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257406734_A_survey_on_activity_recognition_and_behavior_understanding_in_video_surveillance", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258159529_Computer_vision-based_object_recognition_for_the_visually_impaired_in_an_indoors_environment_a_survey", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4156272_Triggs_B_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection_In_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221369111_Representing_shape_with_a_spatial_pyramid_kernel_In_CIVR'07", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2540420_Categorization_by_Learning_and_Combining_Object_Parts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220606498_Developmental_Stereo_Emergence_of_Disparity_Preference_in_Models_of_the_Visual_Cortex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279384963_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Factor_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4044656_Histogram_intersection_kernel_for_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4771963_Probabilistic_Principal_Component_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221411660_Co-occurrence_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37997003_A_Theory_of_Object_Recognition_Computations_and_Circuits_in_the_Feedforward_Path_of_the_Ventral_Stream_in_Primate_Visual_Cortex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6447133_In_the_Eye_of_the_Beholder_Visual_Experience_and_Categories_in_the_Human_Brain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224323302_Evaluating_color_descriptors_for_object_and_scene_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51126196_Adaptive_shape_processing_in_primary_visual_cortex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226178290_The_Cortexionist_architecture_Behavioural_intelligence_of_artificial_creatures", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19719669_Jones_JP_Stepnoski_A_Palmer_LA_The_two-dimensional_spectral_structure_of_simple_receptive_fields_in_cat_striate_cortex_J_Neurophysiol_58_1212-1232", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10677670_An_integrated_network_for_invariant_visual_detection_and_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220637823_Ensemble-based_classifiers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269417919_Object_Recognition_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_A_Survey", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4156225_Learning_a_similarity_metric_discriminatively_with_application_to_face_verification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279900928_Probabilistic_Principal_Component_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222198469_Neurophysiology_of_shape_processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263091712_Deep_Neural_Networks_Rival_the_Representation_of_Primate_IT_Cortex_for_Core_Visual_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271438401_Feature_extraction_and_reduction_strategy_based_on_pyramid_HOG_and_hierarchal_exploitation_of_cortex-like_mechanisms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261047195_Robust_Action_Recognition_Based_on_a_Hierarchical_Model", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12375179_Oja_E_Independent_Component_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Applications_Neural_Networks_134-5_411-430", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224608205_Theory_of_communication_Part_1_The_analysis_of_information", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection"]}
