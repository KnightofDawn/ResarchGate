In this paper we look to the future: what is the next frontier in visual recognition? We offer one possible answer to this question. We propose a detailed image annotation that captures information beyond the visible pixels and requires complex reasoning about full scene structure. Specifically, we create an amodal segmentation of each image: the full extent of each region is marked, not just the visible pixels. Annotators outline and name all salient regions in the image and specify a partial depth order. The result is a rich scene structure, including visible and occluded portions of each region, figure-ground edge information, semantic labels, and object overlap. To date, we have labeled 500 images in the BSDS dataset with at least five annotators per image. Critically, the resulting full scene annotation is surprisingly consistent between annotators. For example, for edge detection our annotations have substantially higher human consistency than the original BSDS edges while providing a greater challenge for existing algorithms. We are currently annotating ~5000 images from the MS COCO dataset.
