However, because of their high computational complexity, detection efficiency is still a frustrating problem even with the help of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). To improve detection efficiency, this paper proposes to share features across a group of DNNs that correspond to pedestrian models of different sizes. By sharing features, the computational burden for extracting features from an image pyramid can be significantly reduced. Simultaneously, we can detect pedestrians of several different scales on one single layer of an image pyramid. Furthermore, the improvement of detection efficiency is achieved with negligible loss of detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267101684_Distributed_Object_Detection_With_Linear_SVMs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51539292_Pedestrian_Detection_An_Evaluation_of_the_State_of_the_Art", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224164350_New_Features_and_Insights_for_Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279271266_An_Improved_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network_for_Object_Image_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275059369_AU-inspired_Deep_Networks_for_Facial_Expression_Feature_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286176572_Switchable_Deep_Network_for_Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235360690_Fast_Image_Scanning_with_Deep_Max-Pooling_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268452043_Ten_Years_of_Pedestrian_Detection_What_Have_We_Learned", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253329079_A_discriminative_deep_model_for_pedestrian_detection_with_occlusion_handling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269838895_Efficient_object_detection_by_prediction_in_3D_space", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270971725_Flexible_sliding_windows_with_adaptive_pixel_strides", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261857512_Joint_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265748773_Learning_Multiple_Layers_of_Features_from_Tiny_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263736593_Analyzing_the_Performance_of_Multilayer_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253329335_Single-Pedestrian_Detection_Aided_by_Two-Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278648177_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262400254_Multi-stage_Contextual_Deep_Learning_for_Pedestrian_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233815499_Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-Stage_Feature_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4156272_Triggs_B_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection_In_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262568634_Descriptor_Matching_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_a_Comparison_to_SIFT"]}
