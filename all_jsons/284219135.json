We build a deep model to capture these dynamics based on LSTM (long-short term memory) models. To make use of these ob- servations, we present a 2-stage deep temporal model for the group activity recognition problem. In our model, a LSTM model is designed to represent action dynamics of in- dividual people in a sequence and another LSTM model is designed to aggregate human-level information for whole activity understanding. We evaluate our model over two datasets: the collective activity dataset and a new volley- ball dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model improves group activity recognition perfor- mance with compared to baseline methods."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276275302_HiRF_Hierarchical_Random_Field_for_Collective_Activity_Recognition_in_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236025290_Cost-Sensitive_Top-DownBottom-Up_Inference_for_Multiscale_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262209501_A_Unified_Framework_for_Multi-target_Tracking_and_Collective_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224135171_What_are_they_doing_Collective_activity_classification_using_spatio-temporal_relationship_among_people", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254961_Learning_context_for_collective_activity_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278413691_Deep_Structured_Models_For_Group_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268525836_Long-term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition_and_Description", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272195511_Visual_Recognition_by_Counting_Instances_A_Multi-Instance_Cardinality_Potential_Kernel", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269339562_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320646_Dlib-ml_A_Machine_Learning_Toolkit", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111664_HMDB51_A_Large_Video_Database_for_Human_Motion_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479488_Multi-Agent_Event_Detection_Localization_and_Role_Assignment", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283566_Social_Roles_in_Hierarchical_Models_for_Human_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51855540_Discriminative_Latent_Models_for_Recognizing_Contextual_Group_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254768_Multi-agent_event_recognition_in_structured_scenarios", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274403697_Beyond_Short_Snippets_Deep_Networks_for_Video_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261248621_Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4090526_Recognizing_human_actions_A_local_SVM_approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388101_Fully_Connected_Deep_Structured_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277145214_Joint_Inference_of_Groups_Events_and_Human_Roles_in_Aerial_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228519111_Recognizing_Plays_in_American_Football_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233815759_UCF101_A_Dataset_of_101_Human_Actions_Classes_From_Videos_in_The_Wild", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263652703_Complex_Activity_Recognition_using_Granger_Constrained_DBN_GCDBN_in_Sports_and_Surveillance_Video", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263048918_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269636281_Translating_Videos_to_Natural_Language_Using_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51025101_Action_Recognition_by_Dense_Trajectories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256979980_A_Survey_of_Vision-Based_Methods_for_Action_Representation_Segmentation_and_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280330273_Every_Moment_Counts_Dense_Detailed_Labeling_of_Actions_in_Complex_Videos"]}
