To date, no objective evidence has established a link between short-term child-robot interactions and long-term child-human interactions. We report on a therapy model that uses a robot in no more than 20% of available therapy time, and describe how a humanoid robot can be used during that limited time to promote generalizable child-human interactions. Preliminary evidence indicates that such low-dose robotics can promote positive child-human interactions."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4201046_Designing_and_observing_human-robot_interactions_for_the_study_of_social_development_and_its_disorders", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220474031_Exploring_the_use_of_a_mobile_robot_as_an_imitation_agent_with_children_with_low-functioning_autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228364332_Does_appearance_matter_in_the_interaction_of_children_with_autism_with_a_humanoid_robot_Interact_Stud", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244459539_Effects_of_Repeated_Exposure_to_a_Humanoid_Robot_on_Children_with_Autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37425172_Effects_of_repeated_exposure_of_a_humanoid_robot_on_children_with_autism"]}
