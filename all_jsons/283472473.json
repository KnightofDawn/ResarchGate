However, it is widely known that non-linear classifiers can generally provide more accurate classification but at a higher computational cost involved in their training and testing procedures. In this paper, we propose a new efficient and accurate non-linear hierarchical classification method that uses the aforementioned deep learning representations. In essence, our classifier is based on a binary tree, where each node is represented by a linear classifier trained using a loss function that minimizes the classification error in a non-greedy way, in addition to postponing hard classification problems to further down the tree. In comparison with linear classifiers, our training process increases only marginally the training and testing time complexities, while showing competitive classification accuracy results. In addition, our method is shown to generalize better than shallow non-linear clas-sifiers. Empirical validation shows that the proposed classifier produces more accurate classification results when compared to several linear and non-linear classifiers on Pascal VOC07 database."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224744237_Zisserman_A_Video_Google_A_text_retrieval_approach_to_object_matching_in_videos_In_ICCV", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221303896_Improving_the_Fisher_Kernel_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221663833_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262380711_Return_of_the_Devil_in_the_Details_Delving_Deep_into_Convolutional_Nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281886334_Learning_and_Transferring_Mid-Level_Image_Representations_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343922_Support_Vector_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344904_Convolutional_deep_belief_networks_for_scalable_unsupervised_learning_of_hierarchical_representations_In_Proc_intl_conf_on_machine_learning_ICML", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225070191_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-Line_Learning_and_an_Application_to_Boosting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4193929_Probabilistic_Boosting-Tree_Learning_Discriminative_Models_for_Classification_Recognition_and_Clustering", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110602_Discriminative_learning_of_relaxed_hierarchy_for_large-scale_visual_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248516115_The_pascal_visual_object_classes_challenge_2006_results", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2453996_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240224936_Rapid_object_detection_using_a_boosted_cascade_of_simple_features_In_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364644_Recognizing_Indoor_Scenes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362554_SUN_database_Large-scale_scene_recognition_from_abbey_to_zoo"]}
