The recently developed dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is modified and applied to the system under study, to overcome the problem of \u201cexplosion of terms\u201d associated with the backstepping design procedure. The input-to-state stability (ISS) property is ensured by the robust nonlinear damping terms, and the ultimate control error bounds are made sufficiently small by the adaptive laws. Experimental results are included to show the excellent position tracking performance of the designed control system. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
