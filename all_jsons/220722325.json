The intention is to reveal all details of our effort focused on breaking HUGO - one of the most advanced steganographic systems ever published. We believe that researchers working in steganalysis of digital media and related fields will find it interesting, inspiring, and perhaps even entertaining to read about the details of our journey, including the dead ends, false hopes, surprises, obstacles, and lessons learned. This information is usually not found in technical papers that only show the final polished approach. This work accompanies our other paper in this volume [9]."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722130_Break_Our_Steganographic_System_The_Ins_and_Outs_of_Organizing_BOSS", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224318264_JPEG_image_steganalysis_utilizing_both_intrablock_and_interblock_correlations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3343272_Steganalysis_of_LSB_matching_in_grayscale_images_Signal_Proc_Lett_IEEE", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40653276_Steganalysis_by_Subtractive_Pixel_Adjacency_Matrix", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722273_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722133_A_Markov_Process_Based_Approach_to_Effective_Attacking_JPEG_Steganography", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225512198_Break_Our_Steganographic_System_The_Ins_and_Outs_of_Organizing_BOSS", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228674613_New_blind_steganalysis_and_its_implications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228670286_Calibration_revisited", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722177_Feature-Based_Steganalysis_for_JPEG_Images_and_Its_Implications_for_Future_Design_of_Steganographic_Schemes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224397412_Digital_image_forensics", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221011162_On_estimation_of_secret_message_length_in_LSB_steganography_in_spatial_domain", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242103208_Revisiting_Weighted_Stego-Image_Steganalysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252654754_Steganalysis_in_high_dimensions_Fusing_classifiers_built_on_random_subspaces", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228821328_Merging_Markov_and_DCT_features_for_multi-class_JPEG_steganalysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722119_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
