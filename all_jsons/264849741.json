The LINDO framework is an open system that manages the indexing, storage and retrieval of multimedia contents that are distributed in different remote servers and generated in a real time basis. The main objective of this framework is to provide efficient information retrieval with minimal processing costs. This was achieved through the proposal of an efficient decentralized content indexing mechanism. When considering the pervasive and mobile access to the managed content, the need of an access control becomes essential. In this paper, we apply an access control layer on top of the LINDO architecture that manages access based on the RBAC model and realizes decision making using the XACML standard. We explore the challenges that face the system in processing access requests showing how an access denial could influence the system's usability especially when returned to a user facing an important situation. Thus, we propose to apply flexible decision making that searches for alternative resources. This operation is performed using PSQRS, a query rewriting system that aims to provide users with pervasive accessibility where they could access any needed multimedia source at anytime, anywhere and anyhow."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3885175_Video-based_multi-agent_traffic_surveillance_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220974163_Distributed_Information_Retrieval_and_Automatic_Identification_of_Music_Works_in_SAPIR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221338697_Adaptive_Solutions_for_Access_Control_within_Pervasive_Healthcare_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253069726_Publication_Framework_for_Content-Based_Search_in_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Multimedia_Databases", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221464790_A_Distributed_Architecture_for_Flexible_Multimedia_Management_and_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241626863_Adapting_Indexation_to_the_Content_Context_and_Queries_Characteristics_in_Distributed_Multimedia_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221572398_SMARXO_Towards_secured_multimedia_applications_by_adopting_RBAC_XML_and_object-relational_database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24164143_Role-Based_Access_Controls", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228343384_Weblab_An_integration_infrastructure_to_ease_the_development_of_multimedia_processing_applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224621406_Candela-Storage_Analysis_and_Retrieval_of_Video_Content_in_Distributed_Systems_Real-Time_Video_Surveillance_and_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220608807_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_Systems-_Reviewing_and_Benchmarking", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221276713_CANDELA_-_Integrated_Storage_Analysis_and_Distribution_of_Video_Content_for_Intelligent_Information_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220664330_Building_a_web-scale_image_similarity_search_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232631103_Candela-Storage_Analysis_and_Retrieval_of_Video_Content_in_Distributed_Systems_Personal_Mobile_Multimedia_Management", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221406401_An_Access_Control_System_for_Multimedia_Content_Distribution", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227292091_Multimodal_Video_Indexing_A_Review_of_the_State-Of-The-Art", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221367033_Access_control_confidentiality_and_privacy_for_video_surveillance_databases", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221368918_Interactive_components_for_visual_exploration_of_multimedia_archives"]}
