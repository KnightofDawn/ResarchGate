However, according to our observation, the recall for particular indexes and queries can fluctuate considerably. In order to stabilize the recall, we propose a query-evaluation model that exploits several variants of the search index. This approach is applicable to a significant subset of current approximate methods with a focus on techniques based purely on metric postulates. Applying this approach to the M-Index structure, we perform extensive measurements on large datasets and we show that this approach has a positive impact on the recall stability and it suppresses the most unsatisfactory cases. Further, the results indicate that the proposed approach can also increase the general average recall for given overall search costs."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228614002_Approximate_similarity_search_in_metric_spaces_using_inverted_files", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3845881_PAC_nearest_neighbor_queries_Approximate_and_controlled_search_in_high-dimensional_and_metric_spaces_Proc_16th_Int_Conf_Data_Eng_ICDE_2000", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2373366_M-tree_An_Efficient_Access_Method_for_Similarity_Search_in_Metric_Spaces", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2634460_Similarity_Search_in_High_Dimensions_via_Hashing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221310821_Multi-Probe_LSH_Efficient_Indexing_for_High-Dimensional_Similarity_Search", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221338288_Metric_Index_An_Efficient_and_Scalable_Solution_for_Similarity_Search", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221338296_On_Locality-sensitive_indexing_in_generic_metric_spaces", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220657989_Approximate_similarity_search_A_multi-faceted_problem", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220473595_Approximate_Similarity_Retrieval_with_M-Trees", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220503292_Metric_Index_An_efficient_and_scalable_solution_for_precise_and_approximate_similarity_search", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220696382_Similarity_Search_-_The_Metric_Space_Approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220664330_Building_a_web-scale_image_similarity_search_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215458558_Locality-sensitive_hashing_scheme_based_on_p-stable_distributions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220887464_Proximity_Searching_in_High_Dimensional_Spaces_with_a_Proximity_Preserving_Order", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4193539_Utilizing_indexes_for_approximate_and_on-line_nearest_neighbor_queries", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45853804_CoPhIR_a_Test_Collection_for_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5234381_Effective_Proximity_Retrieval_by_Ordering_Permutations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221338246_CoPhIR_Image_Collection_under_the_Microscope", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221613529_Modeling_LSH_for_Performance_Tuning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223287155_Approximate_similarity_search_A_multi-faceted_problem"]}
