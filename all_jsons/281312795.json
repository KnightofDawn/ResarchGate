Temporally structured models would seem obvious to tackle this set of problems, but so far, cases where these models have outperformed simpler unstructured bag-of-word types of models are scarce. With the increasing availability of large human activity datasets, combined with the development of novel feature coding techniques that yield more compact representations, it is time to revisit structured generative approaches. Here, we describe an end-to-end generative approach from the encoding of features to the structural modeling of complex human activities by applying Fisher vectors and temporal models for the analysis of video sequences. We systematically evaluate the proposed approach on several available datasets (ADL, MPIICooking, and Breakfast datasets) using a variety of performance metrics. Through extensive system evaluations, we demonstrate that combining compact video representations based on Fisher Vectors with HMM-based modeling yields very significant gains in accuracy and when properly trained with sufficient training samples, structured temporal models outperform unstructured bag-of-word types of models by a large margin on the tested performance metric."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220566360_Human_Activity_Analysis_A_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236156020_A_survey_of_video_datasets_for_human_action_and_activity_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254868_Modeling_human_activities_as_speech", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232048089_Fisher_Vectors_Beyond_Bag-of-Visual-Words_Image_Representations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228625565_Discovering_a_language_for_human_activity", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2463681_Exploiting_Generative_Models_in_Discriminative_Classifiers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239064829_A_Test_For_Normality_of_Observations_and_Regression_Residuals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51866280_Aggregating_Local_Image_Descriptors_into_Compact_Codes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261214980_The_Language_of_Actions_Recovering_the_Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Goal-Directed_Human_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243768141_On_The_Kolmogorov-Smirnov_Test_for_Normality_With_Mean_and_Variance_Unknown", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304851_Representing_Pairwise_Spatial_and_Temporal_Relations_for_Action_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224135905_Activity_recognition_using_the_velocity_histories_of_tracked_keypoints_In_IEEE_ICCV", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262167796_Time_matters_capturing_variation_in_time_in_video_using_fisher_kernels", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262280337_Action_and_Event_Recognition_with_Fisher_Vectors_on_a_Compact_Feature_Set", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281258395_Fisher_kernels_on_visual_vocabularies_for_image_categorization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221303896_Improving_the_Fisher_Kernel_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660027_View-Invariant_Representation_and_Recognition_of_Actions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221305191_Tracklet_Descriptors_for_Action_Modeling_and_Video_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283554_A_database_for_fine_grained_activity_detection_of_cooking_activities_In_IEEE_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226057232_Semantic_Representation_and_Recognition_of_Continued_and_Recursive_Human_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257672261_Image_Classification_with_the_Fisher_Vector_Theory_and_Practice", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4193939_Conditional_models_for_contextual_human_motion_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261038500_Large-scale_web_video_event_classification_by_use_of_Fisher_Vectors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224330777_Machine_recognition_of_human_activities_a_survey_IEEE_TCSVT", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221572285_VLFeat_An_open_and_portable_library_of_computer_vision_algorithms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262320131_Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364410_Action_recognition_with_multiscale_spatio-temporal_contexts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262235263_A_Comparative_Study_of_Encoding_Pooling_and_Normalization_Methods_for_Action_Recognition"]}
