Their context-aware processing makes them a suitable candidate for segmentation-free Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, where recognition is done on text-line level. These networks have shown promising results for cursive scripts where individual characters change their shapes based on their position in a word or a ligature. In this paper, we report the results of applying these networks to Devanagari script, where each consonant-consonant conjuncts and consonant-vowel combinations take different forms based on their position in the word. We also introduce a new database, Deva-DB, of Devanagari script (free of cost) to aid the research towards a robust Devanagari OCR system. On this database, LSTM-based OCRopus systems yield error rates ranging from 1.2% to 9.0% depending upon the complexity of the training and test data.Comparison with open-source Tesseract system is also presented for the same database."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232631162_Online_Handwriting_Mongolia_Words_Recognition_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261230362_Recognition_of_printed_Devanagari_text_using_BLSTM_Neural_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261126601_High-Performance_OCR_for_Printed_English_and_Fraktur_using_LSTM_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224364372_Offline_Handwritten_Devanagari_Word_Recognition_A_Holistic_Approach_Based_on_Directional_Chain_Code_Feature_and_HMM", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255620288_Neural_Combination_of_ANN_and_HMM_for_Handwritten_Devanagari_Numeral_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4033353_A_bilingual_OCR_for_Hindi-Telugu_documents_and_its_applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228740725_Optical_Character_Recognition_OCR_for_Printed_Devnagari_Script_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36419563_Supervised_Sequence_Labelling_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260341561_Offline_Printed_Urdu_Nastaleeq_Script_Recognition_with_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095594_Modeling_Temporal_Dependencies_in_High-Dimensional_SequencesApplication_to_Polyphonic_Music_Generation_and_Transcription", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261273016_Scanning_Neural_Network_for_Text_Line_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4047258_Creation_of_data_resources_and_design_of_an_evaluation_test_bed_for_Devanagari_script_recognition"]}
