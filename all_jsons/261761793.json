For this reason, an efficient retrieval method for the motion database is very important. The retrieval method needs an appropriate indexing scheme and an effective similarity measure that can organize the existing motion data well. In this paper, we represent a human motion hierarchical index structure and adopt a nonlinear method to segment motion sequences. Based on this, we extract motion patterns and then we employ a fast similarity measure algorithm for motion pattern similarity computation to efficiently retrieve motion sequences. The experiment results show that the approach proposed in our paper is effective and efficient."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224436826_Indexing_3-D_Human_Motion_Repositories_for_Content-Based_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220763269_A_Quick_Filtering_for_Similarity_Queries_in_Motion_Capture_Databases", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220954803_Content-Based_Human_Motion_Retrieval_with_Automatic_Transition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220792069_Q_Perceptually_consistent_example-based_human_motion_retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220184451_Efficient_Content-Based_Retrieval_of_Motion_Capture_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221266558_3D_Motion_Sequence_Retrieval_Based_on_Data_Distribution_ICME_2008", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220988751_Hierarchical_Indexing_Structure_for_3D_Human_Motions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221311125_Indexing_Large_Human-Motion_Databases", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224718907_Content-Based_Cross_Search_for_Human_Motion_Data_using_Time-Varying_Mesh_and_Motion_Capture_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220844665_Efficient_Motion_Search_in_Large_Motion_Capture_Databases_LNCS_4291", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220618247_Fast_Pattern_Matching_in_Strings", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220067451_Efficient_motion_data_indexing_and_retrieval_with_local_similarity_measure_of_motion_strings", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220506113_Compression_of_Human_Motion_Capture_Data_Using_Motion_Pattern_Indexing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220214532_Segmentation_and_recognition_of_motion_streams_by_similarity_search"]}
