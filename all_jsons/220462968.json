Experimental results showed that the proposed method could estimate segment boundaries significantly better than an HMM or a multilayer perceptron-based method. Furthermore, we incorporated the BRNN-based segment boundary estimator into the HMM-based and segment model-based recognition systems. As a result, we confirmed that (1) BRNN outputs were effective for improving the recognition rate and reducing computational time in an HMM-based recognition system and (2) segment lattices obtained by the proposed methods dramatically reduce the computational complexity of segment model-based recognition. \u00a9 1999 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 30(4): 20\u201330, 1999"}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5583952_Application_of_recurrent_nets_to_phone_probability_estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3316656_Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333469_From_HMM's_to_Segment_Models_A_Unified_View_of_Stochastic_Modeling_for_Speech_Recognition"]}
