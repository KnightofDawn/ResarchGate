The framework is modular including sensing, interpretation, behaviour generation, and game components. We propose a generic formulation of action selection rules based on observed social and emotional signals, the agent\u2019s personality, and the social relation be- tween agent and player. The rules are formulated such that its variables can easily be obtained from real data. We illustrate and evaluate our framework using a simple social game called The Smile Game.
