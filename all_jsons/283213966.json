In the BOVW the SIFT and SURF descriptors are compared, densely extracted and using MSER, clustered with KMeans and unsupervised Optimum-Path Forest (OPF-U) and classi\ufb01ed with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and supervised Optimum-Path Forest(OPF-S). The accuracy is evaluated in the Caltech101 dataset and in a new dataset with 12 thousand images of products in 36categories. The CNN as a natural descriptor with a SVM classi\ufb01er obtained the best accuracy with 0,856 in the Caltech101 dataset and 0,906 in the created dataset (scale from 0 to 1). The CNN modeled without previous training obtained the accuracy 0,540 in the Caltech101 and 0,710 in the created dataset. Both CNNs, with and without previous training, resulted in a better accuracy than the BOVW method.
