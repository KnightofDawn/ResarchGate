In contrast to approaches that successively recognize actions and activities, our approach jointly models actions and activities in a unified framework, and their labels are simultaneously predicted. The model is embedded with a latent layer that is able to capture a richer class of contextual information in both state-state and observation-state pairs. Although loops are present in the model, the model has an overall linear-chain structure, where the exact inference is tractable. Therefore, the model is very efficient in both inference and learning. The parameters of the graphical model are learned with a Structured Support Vector Machine (Structured-SVM). A data-driven approach is used to initialize the latent variables; therefore, no manual labeling for the latent states is required. The experimental results from using two benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, and our model is computationally more efficient."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222684405_Towards_Robotic_Assistants_in_Nursing_Homes_Challenges_and_Results", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231609161_Learning_Human_Activities_and_Object_Affordances_from_RGB-D_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220566360_Human_Activity_Analysis_A_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362367_Learning_human_actions_via_information_maximization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3560574_Analyzing_and_recognizing_walking_figures_in_XYT", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221473215_Understanding_human_intentions_via_Hidden_Markov_Models_in_autonomous_mobile_robots", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4343268_Spatial-Temporal_correlatons_for_unsupervised_action_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261353123_Anticipating_human_activities_for_reactive_robotic_response", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224557510_Multi-sensor_fusion_for_human_daily_activity_recognition_in_robot-assisted_living", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362328_Hidden_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Gesture_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361492_Max-Margin_hidden_conditional_random_fields_for_human_action_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221363985_Optimizing_Binary_MRFs_via_Extended_Roof_Duality", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283558_Learning_Latent_Temporal_Structure_for_Complex_Event_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230873058_The_Cutting-Plane_Method_for_Solving_Convex_Programs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343422_Cutting-Plane_Training_of_Structural_SVMs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261353152_Posture_recognition_with_a_top-view_camera", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264310257_Learning_Latent_Structure_for_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261317402_Model_recommendation_for_action_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221076691_Active-learning_assisted_self-reconfigurable_activity_recognition_in_a_dynamic_environment", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260670886_A_Survey_on_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Wearable_Sensors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6139655_Hidden_Conditional_Random_Fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220497536_Activity_recognition_using_semi-Markov_models_on_real_world_smart_home_datasets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319911_Hidden-Unit_Conditional_Random_Fields", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361842_Learning_realistic_human_actions_from_movies_In_IEEE_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346169_Learning_structural_SVMs_with_latent_variables", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660110_Human_Action_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Using_Discriminative_Semi-Markov_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3450481_Shibata_T_Living_with_Seal_Robots-_Its_sociopsychological_and_Physiological_Influences_on_the_Elderly_at_a_Care_House_IEEE_Transactions_on_Robotics_235_972-980", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265551588_Assistive_technology_design_and_development_for_acceptable_robotics_companions_for_ageing_years", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51914487_Unstructured_Human_Activity_Detection_from_RGBD_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264310258_Multi-User_Identification_and_Efficient_User_Approaching_by_Fusing_Robot_and_Ambient_Sensors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221454358_Conditional_random_fields_for_activity_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320388_Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224136049_Spatio-Temporal_Relationship_Match_Video_Structure_Comparison_for_Recognition_of_Complex_Human_Activities"]}
