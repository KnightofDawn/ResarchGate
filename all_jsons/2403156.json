However, in spite of many years of research, optical readers that can recognize handwritten materials at a satisfactory rate are rare. Reasons for difficulty in reading hand-printed alphanumeric data include the variety of handwritten characters and the ambiguity in the distinction of characters. This paper proposes a new and improved recognition module designed to read the courtesy amount on Brazilian checks. This system focuses on a neural network classifier with a structural system to verify recognition which have both been designed and tailored in a unique way.
