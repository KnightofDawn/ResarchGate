from patch-kernel", "authors": {"1": "Shuicheng Yan", "4": "M. Hasegawa-Johnson", "3": "Ming Liu", "2": "Xi Zhou", "5": "T S Huang"}, "abstract": "  ABSTRACT In this paper, we present a patch-based regression framework for addressing the human age and head pose estimation problems. Firstly, each image is encoded as an ensemble of orderless coordinate patches, the global distribution of which is described by Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and then each image is further expressed as a specific distribution model by Maximum a Posteriori adaptation from the global GMM. Then the patch-kernel is designed for characterizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the derived models for any two images, and its discriminating power is further enhanced by a weak learning process, called inter-modality similarity synchronization. Finally, kernel regression is employed for ultimate human age or head pose estimation. These three stages are complementary to each other, and jointly minimize the regression error. The effectiveness of this regression framework is validated by three experiments: 1) on the YAMAHA aging database, our solution brings a more than 50% reduction in age estimation error compared with the best reported results; 2) on the FG-NET aging database, our solution based on raw image features performs even better than the state-of-the-art algorithms which require fine face alignment for extracting warped appearance features; and 3) on the CHIL head pose database, our solution significantly outperforms the best one reported in the CLEAR07 evaluation.
