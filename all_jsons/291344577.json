However, sometimes the amateur photographer is hindered by fences in the scene which have to be removed after the image has been captured. Conventional approaches to image de-fencing suffer from inaccurate and non-robust fence detection apart from being limited to processing images of only static occluded scenes. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated de-fencing algorithm using a video of the dynamic scene. We use convolutional neural networks for detecting fence pixels. We provide qualitative as well as quantitative comparison results with existing lattice detection algorithms on the existing PSU NRT data set [1] and a proposed challenging fenced image dataset. The inverse problem of fence removal is solved using split Breg-man technique assuming total variation of the de-fenced image as the regularization constraint."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45660312_Large_Displacement_Optical_Flow_Descriptor_Matching_in_Variational_Motion_Estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8264912_Region_Filling_and_Object_Removal_by_Exemplar-Based_Image_Inpainting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269633959_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1-egularized_problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220183653_Scene_completion_using_millions_of_photographs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273395483_Image_Completion_Approaches_Using_the_Statistics_of_Similar_Patches", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282200011_A_multimodal_approach_for_image_de-fencing_and_depth_inpainting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271554783_Seeing_through_the_fence_Image_de-fencing_using_a_video_sequence", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282566972_Super-resolution_de-fencing_Simultaneous_fence_removal_and_high-resolution_image_recovery_using_videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266888741_Prediction_as_a_Candidate_for_Learning_Deep_Hierarchical_Models_of_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289856654_Combined_First_and_Second_Order_Total_Variation_Inpainting_using_Split_Bregman", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26756908_Deformed_Lattice_Detection_in_Real-World_Images_Using_Mean-Shift_Belief_Propagation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220744941_Image_De-fencing_Revisited", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6534338_Video_Inpainting_Under_Constrained_Camera_Motion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111636_Learning_Based_Digital_Matting"]}
