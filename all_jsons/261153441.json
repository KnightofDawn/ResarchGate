linear units and dropout", "authors": {"1": "George E. Dahl", "3": "Geoffrey E. Hinton", "2": "Tara N. Sainath"}, "abstract": "Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on a variety of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random \u201cdropout\u201d procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly available Bayesian optimization code."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224216007_Acoustic_Modeling_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220655572_Context-Dependent_Pre-Trained_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Large-Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265178583_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors_arXiv_preprint_arXiv12070580", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346269_Extracting_and_composing_robust_features_with_denoising_autoencoders", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792705_What_is_the_Best_Multi-Stage_Architecture_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224246556_Learning_a_better_representation_of_speech_sound_waves_using_restricted_Boltzmann_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228619939_The_IBM_Attila_speech_recognition_toolkit", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228446017_Making_Deep_Belief_Networks_Effective_for_Large_Vocabulary_Continuous_Speech_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238727850_CUDAMat_a_CUDA-based_matrix_class_for_Python", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261112625_Auto-encoder_bottleneck_features_using_deep_belief_networks"]}
