The idea is to approximate a vector using the composition of several elements selected from a source dictionary and to represent this vector by a short code composed of the indices of the selected elements. The inner product between a query vector and a database vector is efficiently estimated from the query vector and the short code of the database vector. We show the superior performance of the proposed group $M$-selection algorithm that selects $M$ elements from $M$ source dictionaries for vector approximation in terms of search accuracy and efficiency for compact codes of the same length via theoretical and empirical analysis. Experimental results on large-scale datasets ($1M$ and $1B$ SIFT features, $1M$ linear models and Netflix) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
