A high degree of Quality-of-Service (QoS) for BSN is extremely required. Inter-user interference is introduced by the simultaneous communication of BSNs congregating in the same area. In this paper, a decentralized inter-user interference suppression algorithm for BSN, namely DISG, is proposed. Each BSN measures the interference from other BSNs and then adaptively selects the suitable channel and transmission power. By utilizing non-cooperative game theory and no regret learning algorithm, DISG provides an adaptive inter-user interference suppression strategy. The correctness and effectiveness of DISG is theoretically proved, and the experimental results show that DISG can reduce the effect of inter-user interference effectively."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220521428_Guest_Editorial_Body_Sensor_Networks_From_Theory_to_Emerging_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221192351_Body_Area_Networks_for_Movement_Analysis_in_Physiotherapy_Treatments", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228623061_QoS_Issues_with_Focus_on_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4373005_Novel_Consensus_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_with_Noise_and_Interference_Suppression", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321875_Bio-Inspired_Sensor_Network_Design", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224289144_CBPMACTFC_A_Wireless_Sensor_Network_MAC_Protocol_for_Systems_with_Burst_and_Periodic_Signals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49241737_Novel_QoS_Scheduling_and_Energy-saving_MAC_protocol_for_Body_Sensor_Networks_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224440412_Highly_Reliable_Energy-Saving_MAC_for_Wireless_Body_Sensor_Networks_in_Healthcare_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4373370_Improving_Reliability_in_Multi-hop_Body_Sensor_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221243684_BodyQoS_Adaptive_and_Radio-Agnostic_QoS_for_Body_Sensor_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224331733_Game_theoretic_approach_for_channel_assignment_and_power_control_with_no-internal-regret_learning_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695781_Learning_correlated_equilibria_in_games_with_compact_sets_of_strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228460521_The_OMNET_discrete_event_simulation_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4151038_Reducing_inter-cluster_TDMA_interference_by_adaptive_MAC_allocation_in_sensor_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241478140_Analyzing_and_Improving_Reliability_in_Multi-hop_Body_Sensor_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238162251_A_Reinforcement_Procedure_Leading_to_Correlated_Equilibrium", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4282467_From_Simulation_to_Real_Deployments_in_WSN_and_Back", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221313053_Wireless_Propagation_and_Coexistence_of_Medical_Body_Sensor_Networks_for_Ambulatory_Patient_Monitoring", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221313066_Inter-User_Interference_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_Preliminary_Investigation_and_an_Infrastructure-Based_Solution", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224703749_A_WBAN-based_System_for_Health_Monitoring_at_Home", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220429054_A_Nash_game_algorithm_for_SIR-based_power_control_in_3G_wireless_CDMA_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220094261_Adaptive_and_Radio-Agnostic_QoS_for_Body_Sensor_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3233585_A_Framework_for_Uplink_Power_Control_in_Cellular_Radio_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3335118_A_Nash_game_algorithm_for_SINR-based_power_control_in_3G_wireless_CDMA_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221234578_Investigating_network_architectures_for_body_sensor_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239065465_Omnet_discrete_event_simulation_system_2"]}
