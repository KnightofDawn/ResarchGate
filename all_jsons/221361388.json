Ourmethodrep- resents the human body and its parts by an AND/OR graph, which is a multi-level mixture of Markov Random Fields (MRFs). Max-margin learning, which is a generalization of the training algorithm for support vector machines (SVMs), is used to learn the parameters of the AND/OR graph modeldiscriminatively. There are four advantagesfrom this combination of AND/OR graphs and max-margin learning. Firstly, the AND/OR graph allows us to handle enormous articulated poses with a compact graphical model. Sec- ondly, max-margin learning has more discriminative power than the traditional maximum likelihood approach. Thirdly, the parameters of the AND/OR graph model are optimized globally. In particular, the weights of the appearancemodel for individual nodes and the relative importance of spatial relationships between nodes are learnt simultaneously. Fi- nally, the kernel trick can be used to handle high dimen- sional features and to enable complex similarity measure of shapes. We perform comparison experiments on the base- ball datasets, showing significant improvements over state of the art methods.
