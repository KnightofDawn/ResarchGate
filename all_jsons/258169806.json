Semantic richness (NOF: number of features) influenced lexical decision reaction times in that semantically rich words (high NOF) were processed faster than semantically impoverished words (low NOF). Processing in the VWP was faster for high NOF words but only when an onset com-petitor was present in the display (target BREAD, onset competitor BRICK). Adding back-ground speech babble to the spoken stimuli resulted in an advantage for processing high NOF words with and without onset competitors in the display. The results suggest that semantic representations directly contribute to the recognition of spoken words and that sub-optimal listening conditions (e.g., background babble) enhance the role of semantics.
