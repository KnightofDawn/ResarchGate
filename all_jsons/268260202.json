Finding optimal solutions, however, re-quires an enormous computational effort, which becomes critical for large problem instance sizes and, in particular, in situations where fre-quent changes in the environment occur. In this article, we adopt an al-ternative view on production scheduling problems by modelling them as multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. In fact, we interpret job-shop scheduling problems as sequential decision processes and attach to each resource an adaptive agent that makes its job dispatching decisions independently of the other agents and improves its dispatching behavior by trial and error employing a reinforcement learning algorithm. The utilization of concurrently and independently learning agents requires special care in the design of the reinforcement learning algorithm to be applied. Therefore, we develop a novel multi-agent learning algo-rithm, that combines data-efficient batch-mode reinforcement learning, neural network-based value function approximation, and the use of an optimistic inter-agent coordination scheme. The evaluation of our learn-ing framework focuses on numerous established Operations Research benchmark problems and shows that our approach can very well com-pete with alternative solution methods.
