This paper shows how the Map-Reduce paradigm can be applied to indexing algorithms and demonstrates that great scalability can be achieved using Hadoop, a popular Map-Reduce-based framework. Dramatic performance improvements are not however guaranteed a priori: such frameworks are rigid, they severely constrain the possible access patterns to data and scares resource RAM has to be shared. Furthermore, algorithms require major redesign, and may have to settle for sub-optimal behavior. The benefits, however, are many: simplicity for programmers, automatic distribution, fault tolerance, failure detection and automatic re-runs and, last but not least, scalability. We share our experience of adapting a clustering-based high-dimensional indexing algorithm to the Map-Reduce model, and of testing it at large scale with Hadoop as we index 30 billion SIFT descriptors. We foresee that lessons drawn from our work could minimize time, effort and energy invested by other researchers and practitioners working in similar directions.
