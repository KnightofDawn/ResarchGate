In this paper, we report results obtained on an inertial model of a feed drive with potentially sub-optimal parameter setting and designer decisions. Namely, we have tested different reward signals, different number of features to approximate value functions and policies, and different learning gains. The results show CACLA to be a very highly robust approach."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239843999_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Continuous_State_and_Action_Spaces", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220344042_Riedmiller_M_Reinforcement_learning_in_feedback_control_Challenges_and_benchmarks_from_technical_process_control_Machine_Learning_841-2_137-169"]}
