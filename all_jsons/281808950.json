However, most of the design and implementation of these complex models are based on trail-and-error. In this report, the main focus is to consider some of the important factors in designing convolutional networks to perform better. Specifically, classification with wide single-layer networks with large kernels as a general framework is considered. Particularly, we will show that pre-training using unsupervised schemes is vital, reasonable regularization is beneficial and applying of strong regularizers like dropout could be devastating. Pool size is also could be as important as learning procedure itself. In addition, it has been presented that using such a simple and relatively fast model for classifying cats and dogs, performance is close to state-of-the-art achievable by a combination of SVM models on color and texture features.
