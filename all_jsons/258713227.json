This system is composed of several recognizers based on three different recognition technologies, combined using a novel combination method. A framework multi-word recognition based on weighted finite state transducers is presented, using an explicit word segmentation, a combination of isolated word recognizers and a language model. The system was tested both for isolated word recognition and for multi-word line recognition and submitted to the RIMES-ICDAR2011 competition. This system outperformed all previously proposed systems on these tasks."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49799894_Dynamic_and_Contextual_Information_in_HMM_Modeling_for_Handwritten_Word_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221389446_Handwritten_Mail_Classification_Experiments_with_the_Rimes_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2240708_Finite-State_Transducers_in_Language_and_Speech_Processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222870773_Hidden_Markov_model-based_ensemble_methods_for_offline_handwritten_text_line_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2923028_Generalized_Algorithms_for_Constructing_Statistical_Language_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220860678_ICDAR_2011-French_Handwriting_Recognition_Competition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3734420_A_post-processing_system_to_yield_reduced_word_error_rates_Recognizer_Output_Voting_Error_Reduction_ROVER", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252051170_RIMES_evaluation_campaign_for_handwritten_mail_processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3432431_Polikar_R_Ensemble_based_systems_in_decision_making_IEEE_Circuit_Syst_Mag_6_21-45", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220861391_ICDAR_2009_Handwriting_Recognition_Competition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221093844_Neural_Network_Optimization_for_Combinations_in_Identification_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346365_Connectionist_temporal_classification_Labelling_unsegmented_sequence_data_with_recurrent_neural_'networks"]}
