Chan", "2": "Zhi-Qiang Liu"}, "abstract": "We propose an heterogeneous multi-task learning framework for human pose estimation from monocular image with deep convolutional neural network. In particular, we simultaneously learn a pose-joint regressor and a sliding-window body-part detector in a deep network architecture. We show that including the body-part detection task helps to regularize the network, directing it to converge to a good solution. We report competitive and state-of-art results on several data sets. We also empirically show that the learned neurons in the middle layer of our network are tuned to localized body parts."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223969597_Human_Pose_Co-Estimation_and_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261160647_Articulated_people_detection_and_pose_estimation_Reshaping_the_future", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261236793_Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254726_Learning_effective_human_pose_estimation_from_inaccurate_annotation_In_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346162_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254989_Articulated_pose_estimation_with_flexible_mixtures-of-parts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140324_Knowledge_Matters_Importance_of_Prior_Information_for_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259335300_DeepPose_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Deep_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51968606_Building_high-level_features_using_large_scale_unsupervised_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257672265_2D_Articulated_Human_Pose_Estimation_and_Retrieval_in_Almost_Unconstrained_Still_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345354_Learning_Gaussian_processes_from_multiple_tasks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618951_Heterogeneous_Multitask_Learning_with_Joint_Sparsity_Constraints", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240308781_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Scene_Labeling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221305302_We_Are_Family_Joint_Pose_Estimation_of_Multiple_Persons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258055384_Articulated_Human_Detection_with_Flexible_Mixtures_of_Parts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4156272_Triggs_B_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection_In_CVPR", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261259065_Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320600_Learning_Multiple_Tasks_with_Kernel_Methods", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221259998_Better_Appearance_Models_for_Pictorial_Structures", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225223935_Pictorial_Structures_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660082_Twin_Gaussian_Processes_for_Structured_Prediction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261227384_Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286794765_Dropout_A_simple_way_to_prevent_neural_networks_from_overfitting"]}
