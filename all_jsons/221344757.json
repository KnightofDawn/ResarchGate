Gordon", "3": "Casey Marks", "2": "Amy Greenwald"}, "abstract": "Quite a bit is known about minimizing dier- ent kinds of regret in experts problems, and how these regret types relate to types of equi- libria in the multiagent setting of repeated matrix games. Much less is known about the possible kinds of regret in online convex pro- gramming problems (OCPs), or about equi- libria in the analogous multiagent setting of repeated convex games. This gap is unfortu- nate, since convex games are much more ex- pressive than matrix games, and since many important machine learning problems can be expressed as OCPs. In this paper, we work to close this gap: we analyze a spectrum of regret types which lie between external and swap regret, along with their corresponding equilibria, which lie between coarse correlated and correlated equilibrium. We also analyze algorithms for minimizing these regret types. As examples of our framework, we derive al- gorithms for learning correlated equilibria in polyhedral convex games and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. The former is exponentially more ecient than previous algorithms, and the latter is the first of its type."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620268_Convex_Repeated_Games_and_Fenchel_Duality", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620272_No-regret_Algorithms_for_Online_Convex_Programs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695781_Learning_correlated_equilibria_in_games_with_compact_sets_of_strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343922_Support_Vector_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2925243_From_External_to_Internal_Regret", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222506413_Regret_in_the_On-Line_Decision_Problem_Games_Econ_Behav", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225814506_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Online_Decision_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222302500_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Online_Decision_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2413774_Approximate_Solutions_to_Markov_Decision_Processes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2885544_Online_Convex_Programming_and_Generalized_Infinitesimal_Gradient_Ascent", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228989795_Computationally_efficient_coordination_in_game_trees", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247378412_Regret_in_on-line_decision_making", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2519092_Regret_Bounds_for_Prediction_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618259_Computational_Equivalence_of_Fixed_Points_and_No_Regret_Algorithms_and_Convergence_to_Equilibria", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497458_A_General_Class_of_No-Regret_Learning_Algorithms_and_Game-Theoretic_Equilibria", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271513141_Support_Vector_Networks"]}
