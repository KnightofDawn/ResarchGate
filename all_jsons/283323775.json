However, how CNN best copes with multi-label images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex underlying object layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. In this work, we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an arbitrary number of object segment hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared CNN is connected with each hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different hypotheses are aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include: 1) no ground-truth bounding box information is required for training; 2) the whole HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant hypotheses; 3) the shared CNN is flexible and can be well pre-trained with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g., ImageNet; and 4) it may naturally output multi-label prediction results. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 multi-label image datasets well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HCP infrastructure over other state-of-the-arts. In particular, the mAP reaches 90.5% by HCP only and 93.2% after the fusion with our complementary result in [44] based on hand-crafted features on the VOC 2012 dataset."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221750789_Measuring_the_Objectness_of_Image_Windows", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51855547_CPMC_Automatic_Object_Segmentation_Using_Constrained_Parametric_Min-Cuts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262380711_Return_of_the_Devil_in_the_Details_Delving_Deep_into_Convolutional_Nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261121689_Hierarchical_matching_with_side_information_for_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479526_Subcategory-Aware_Object_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_Challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222817667_Learning_generative_visual_models_from_few_training_examples_an_incremental_Bayesian_approach_tested_on_101_object_categories_Comput_Vis_Image_Underst", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259335452_Deep_Convolutional_Ranking_for_Multilabel_Image_Annotation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260642596_Multi-scale_Orderless_Pooling_of_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30766223_Caltech-256_Object_Category_Dataset", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224135968_Combining_efficient_object_localization_and_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792705_What_is_the_Best_Multi-Stage_Architecture_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265748773_Learning_Multiple_Layers_of_Features_from_Tiny_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2439558_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_a_Back-Propagation_Network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220424626_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Hierarchical_Representations_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281886334_Learning_and_Transferring_Mid-Level_Image_Representations_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221303896_Improving_the_Fisher_Kernel_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364427_Locality-constrained_Linear_Coding_for_image_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274404129_Background_Context_Augmented_Hypothesis_Graph_for_Object_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262234968_Semantic_Segmentation_without_Annotating_Segments", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268391577_A_Discriminative_CNN_Video_Representation_for_Event_Detection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278648177_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges"]}
