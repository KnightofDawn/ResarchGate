Hashim", "2": "Siti Fatahiyah Mahamood"}, "abstract": "Abstract Malaysia is experiencing the use of robots for therapy, rehabilitation and skill augmentation in healthcare and wellbeing. Although in its infancy, trepidations, reluctance and apprehension have been the responses to robots taking over humans. In the case of education of brain-impaired children, the parents and teachers of these gifted human beings, the introduction of humanoids for social skills training have been met with the same perceptions. The findings were derived from the qualitative analysis and case study that was conducted at a special-education primary school located in Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. Through interviews with the teachers at the special-education classes, they are of the opinion that the gifted children still need a fellow human being to look up to rather than a \u201cbig toy\u201d. Physically, the teachers look different and the children are able to attach a name to their teachers unlike robots that look the same anywhere. They opined that the human touch far exceeds that of robots, no matter how close the physical resemblance the robots are to a human being. Moreover, the cultural and religious elements exceed the robot's capability in skilling and preparing these special-needs children for their adult life and independence. Also, the emotional and spiritual aspects cannot be replaced by robots. Hence, the findings evidenced an intense emphasis on cultural and religious values for these students with similar implications. No matter the positive reports on the use of robots in developed nations, cultural mores, tradition, ethics and the Islamic faith are more important to these gifted children than modern technology."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233879937_A_Step_Towards_Developing_Adaptive_Robot-Mediated_Intervention_Architecture_ARIA_for_Children_With_Autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248493501_Artificial_sociability_From_embodied_AI_toward_new_understandings_of_personhood", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221757410_An_affordable_compact_humanoid_robot_for_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_interventions_in_children", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259127160_Storytelling_by_a_kindergarten_social_assistive_robot_A_tool_for_constructive_learning_in_preschool_education", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227634318_Robots_and_the_Sacred_in_Science_and_Science_Fiction_Theological_Implications_of_Artificial_Intelligence", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233712063_An_Iron_Age_II_Pictorial_Inscription_from_Jerusalem_Illustrating_Yahweh_and_Asherah", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240723527_Social_Skills_Training_with_Handicapped_Children_A_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23787618_Systematic_Review_of_Early_Intensive_Behavioral_Interventions_for_Children_With_Autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234161208_Feasibility_of_using_a_humanoid_robot_for_enhancing_attention_and_social_skills_in_adolescents_with_autism_spectrum_disorder", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10886388_Ecology_of_development_in_children_with_brain_impairment", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258815713_The_Difference_of_Excellence_in_Educational-support_Robots_Affects_Children's_Learning_English_Vocabularies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274821320_Diverse_Perceptions_of_Social_Support_Asian_Mothers_of_Children_With_Intellectual_Disability", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235821988_Teleoperated_Android_as_an_Embodied_Communication_Medium_A_Case_Study_with_Demented_Elderlies_in_a_Care_Facility", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278086253_Tactile_Interactions_with_a_Humanoid_Robot_Novel_Play_Scenario_Implementations_with_Children_with_Autism"]}
