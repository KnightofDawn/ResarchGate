Their electrical brain activity was simultaneously recorded and processed to determine the brain wave coherence, which is an estimator of brain connectivity. A t test for independent groups was used to determine if, there is a significant different outcome concerning the number and size of the brain connections for the two groups of subjects. Trained group showed a mean of difference of the EEG coherence in the brainwave theta band during exposure to visual stimuli from resting state, significantly higher than the average of the group without specific training (t (636) = 2.7, p = 0.007 <0.5, 0.003 <0.011 <0.02). The effect size was 0.21, after Cohen.
