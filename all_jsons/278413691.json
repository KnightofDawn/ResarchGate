Deep networks are used to recognize the actions of individual people in a scene. Next, a neural-network-based hierarchical graphical model refines the predicted labels for each class by considering dependencies between the classes. This refinement step mimics a message-passing step similar to inference in a probabilistic graphical model. We show that this approach can be effective in group activity recognition, with the deep graphical model improving recognition rates over baseline methods."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224135171_What_are_they_doing_Collective_activity_classification_using_spatio-temporal_relationship_among_people", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261248621_Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262320131_Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256979980_A_Survey_of_Vision-Based_Methods_for_Action_Representation_Segmentation_and_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618925_Beyond_Actions_Discriminative_Models_for_Contextual_Group_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276275302_HiRF_Hierarchical_Random_Field_for_Collective_Activity_Recognition_in_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283566_Social_Roles_in_Hierarchical_Models_for_Human_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236025290_Cost-Sensitive_Top-DownBottom-Up_Inference_for_Multiscale_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257671988_Stochastic_Representation_and_Recognition_of_High-Level_Group_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220611909_Poppe_R_A_Survey_on_Vision-based_Human_Action_Recognition_Image_and_Vision_Computing_286_976-990", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262341972_Activity_analysis_in_crowded_environments_using_social_cues_for_group_discovery_and_human_interaction_modeling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51855540_Discriminative_Latent_Models_for_Recognizing_Contextual_Group_Activities", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261248623_Context-Aware_Modeling_and_Recognition_of_Activities_in_Video", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111425_Learning_spatiotemporal_graphs_of_human_activities_In_ICCV_Boston", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263048918_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262209501_A_Unified_Framework_for_Multi-target_Tracking_and_Collective_Activity_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221363650_Understanding_videos_constructing_plots_learning_a_visually_grounded_storyline_model_from_annotated_videos"]}
