To this end we employ Hough transform to vote in a 3D space for the begin point, the end point and the label of the segmented part of the input stream. An SVM is used to model each class and to suggest putative labeled segments on the timeline. To identify the most plausible segments among the putative ones we apply a dynamic programming algorithm, which maximises an objective function for label assignment in linear time. The performance of our method is evaluated on synthetic as well as on real data (Weizmann and Berkeley multimodal human action database). The proposed approach is of comparable accuracy to the state of the art for online stream segmentation and classification and performs considerably better in the presence of previously unseen actions. \u00a9 2014.
