Hynes"}, "abstract": "Collaborative filtering algorithms are important building blocks in many practical recommendation systems. As a result, many large-scale data processing environments include collaborative filtering models for which the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm is used to compute latent factor matrix decompositions. In this paper, we significantly accelerate the convergence of parallel ALS-based optimization methods for collaborative filtering using a nonlinear conjugate gradient (NCG) wrapper around the ALS iterations. We also provide a parallel implementation of the accelerated ALS-NCG algorithm in the distributed Apache Spark data processing environment and an efficient line search technique requiring only 1 map-reduce operation on distributed datasets. In both serial numerical experiments on a linux workstation and parallel numerical experiments on a 16 node cluster with 256 computing cores, we demonstrate using the MovieLens 20M dataset that the combined ALS-NCG method requires many fewer iterations and less time to reach high ranking accuracies than standalone ALS. In parallel, NCG-ALS achieves an acceleration factor of 4 or greater in clock time when an accurate solution is desired, with the acceleration factor increasing with greater desired accuracy. Furthermore, the NCG acceleration mechanism is fully parallelizable and scales linearly with problem size on datasets with up to nearly 1 billion ratings. Our NCG acceleration approach is versatile and may be used to accelerate other parallel optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent and coordinate descent."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2369002_Item-based_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Algorithms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221654609_Factorization_Meets_the_Neighborhood_A_Multifaceted_Collaborative_Filtering_Model", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257391708_Recommender_systems_survey", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220062980_Industry_Report_Amazoncom_Recommendations_Item-to-Item_Collaborative_Filtering", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241060215_The_Yahoo_Music_Dataset_and_KDD-Cup'11", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220765111_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Implicit_Feedback_Datasets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230873264_Numerical_Optimization_Second_Edition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264123100_A_Nonlinearly_Preconditioned_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Rank-R_Canonical_Tensor_Approximation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51991823_Composing_Scalable_Nonlinear_Solvers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51893496_A_Nonlinear_GMRES_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Canonical_TensorDecomposition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227633479_Two_classes_of_multisecant_methods_for_nonlinear_acceleration", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220179705_Anderson_Acceleration_for_Fixed-Point_Iterations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220432163_Iterative_Procedures_for_Nonlinear_Integral_Equations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261040962_Distributed_Matrix_Completion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261040876_Scalable_Coordinate_Descent_Approaches_to_Parallel_Matrix_Factorization_for_Recommender_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262233351_Resilient_distributed_datasets_A_fault-tolerant_abstraction_for_in-memory_cluster_computing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244473392_Note_sur_la_Convergence_de_Methodes_de_Directions_Conjugees", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220493298_On_Line_Search_Algorithms_with_Guaranteed_Sufficient_Decrease", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268260439_Poblano_v10_A_Matlab_Toolbox_for_Gradient-Based_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221351788_Delay_scheduling_A_simple_technique_for_achieving_locality_and_fairness_in_cluster_scheduling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30416480_An_updated_set_of_Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms_BLAS"]}
