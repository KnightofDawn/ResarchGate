We measure its performance on a spoken digit identification task, where the data was spike-encoded in such a way that classifying the utterances became a di#cult challenge in non-linear timewarping. We find that LSTM gives greatly superior results to an SNN found in the literature, and conclude that the architecture has a place in domains that require the learning of large timewarped datasets, such as automatic speech recognition."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230875873_Connectionist_Speech_Recognition_A_Hybrid_Approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2839938_Gradient_Flow_in_Recurrent_Nets_the_Difficulty_of_Learning_Long-Term_Dependencies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619966_Speech_Recognition_Experiments_with_Perceptrons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11404976_Finding_Downbeats_with_a_Relaxation_Oscillator", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320057_Learning_Precise_Timing_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619375_A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222699291_Error-Backpropagation_in_Temporally_Encoded_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3965998_Finding_temporal_structure_in_music_Blues_improvisation_with_LSTM_recurrent_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10862955_Kalman_filters_improve_LSTM_network_performance_in_problems_unsolvable_by_traditional_recurrent_nets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243683010_The_utility_driven_dynamic_error_propagation_network", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15603570_Hopfield_JJ_Pattern_recognition_computation_using_action_potential_timing_for_stimulus_representation_Nature_376_33-36", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5583952_Application_of_recurrent_nets_to_phone_probability_estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3303030_LSTM_recurrent_networks_learn_simple_context-free_and_context-sensitive_languages", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984124_Rabiner_L_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition_Proc_IEEE_772_257-286", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243656159_In_Pulsed_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2751792_Gradient-Based_Learning_Algorithms_for_Recurrent_Connectionist_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory"]}
