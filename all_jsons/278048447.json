The current approach to training them consists in maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269997813_Grammar_as_a_Foreign_Language", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268451983_Show_and_Tell_A_Neural_Image_Caption_Generator", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268525836_Long-term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition_and_Description", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255643134_Search-Based_Structured_Prediction_as_Classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47646552_A_Reduction_of_Imitation_Learning_and_Structured_Prediction_to_No-RegretOnline_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873038_Incremental_Parsing_with_the_Perceptron_Algorithm", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270878151_A_Dynamic_Oracle_for_Arc-Eager_Dependency_Parsing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269935372_Deep_Captioning_with_Multimodal_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_m-RNN", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268155634_Unifying_Visual-Semantic_Embeddings_with_Multimodal_Neural_Language_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269339562_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268525230_From_Captions_to_Visual_Concepts_and_Back", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268689555_CIDEr_Consensus-based_Image_Description_Evaluation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817587_OntoNotes_The_90_Solution", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228828379_The_Kaldi_speech_recognition_toolkit", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116878_End-to-end_Continuous_Speech_Recognition_using_Attention-based_Recurrent_NN_First_Results"]}
