Although some successful stories have been reported, training RNNs remains highly challenging. Recent research found that a well-trained model can be used as a source of `dark knowledge' to train other models, by use of soft targets generated by the teacher model. This idea has been employed to train simple models from powerful yet complex models. In this paper, we perform an opposite research that uses a simple model to train a complex model such as an RNN. We show that the knowledge transfer learning with soft targets leads to a smoother objective function which simplifies complex model training and improves model generalizability. Additionally, the knowledge transfer learning can be combined with the traditional supervised learning, in a way of either regularization or pre-training. Experiments on an ASR task demonstrated that this method can be successfully applied to train RNNs, without any tricks on the learning scheme (such as momentum) or Hessian approximation.
