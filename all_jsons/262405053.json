Tutored students scored in the 95th percentile, or two sigmas above the mean, on average, compared to students who received traditional classroom instruction. In human-robot interaction research, however, there is relatively little work exploring the potential benefits of personalizing a robot's actions to an individual's strengths and weaknesses. In this study, participants solved grid-based logic puzzles with the help of a personalized or non-personalized robot tutor. Participants' puzzle solving times were compared between two non-personalized control conditions and two personalized conditions (n=80). Although the robot's personalizations were less sophisticated than what a human tutor can do, we still witnessed a \"one-sigma\" improvement (68th percentile) in post-tests between treatment and control groups. We present these results as evidence that even relatively simple personalizations can yield significant benefits in educational or assistive human-robot interactions."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221473479_Relationships_between_user_experiences_and_children's_perceptions_of_the_education_robot", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220204911_An_efficient_algorithm_for_solving_nonograms", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50426287_Pimp_my_Roomba_designing_for_personalization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234046562_Personalization_in_HRI_A_longitudinal_field_experiment", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221473466_Robots_that_express_emotion_elicit_better_human_teaching", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257388546_Long-Term_Interactions_with_Empathic_Robots_Evaluating_Perceived_Support_in_Children", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4177578_Interactive_robots_for_communication-care_a_case-study_in_autism_therapy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4212112_Towards_a_humanoid_museum_guide_robot_that_interacts_with_multiple_persons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4363382_The_design_of_a_semi-autonomous_robot_avatar_for_family_communication_and_education", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221066379_Robots_at_Home_Understanding_Long-Term_Human-Robot_Interaction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017449_Bloom_BS_The_2_Sigma_Problem_The_Search_for_Methods_of_Group_Instruction_as_Effective_as_One-to-One_Tutoring_Educational_Researcher_13_4-16", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236272973_The_Physical_Presence_of_a_Robot_Tutor_Increases_Cognitive_Learning_Gains", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226301831_Building_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_An_Overview", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221473526_The_RUBI_project_a_progress_report", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233237328_The_Relative_Effectiveness_of_Human_Tutoring_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_and_Other_Tutoring_Systems"]}
