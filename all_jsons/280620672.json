Within this paper we shall be presenting a current research focus towards innovative Brain Machine Interfacing (BMI) for Robotic-Prosthetic and rehabilitation applications. It combines advances in neurophysiology, electronics, and rehabilitation. Recent studies indicates that during hand and fingers movements, the cortical hemisphere on the same ipsilateral side of the body as the hand also activates. The paper novelty is based on the theme, to employ electroencephalography (EEG) to record these human brain signals, and control a motorized robotic Robotic-Prosthetic limbs. In addition, the research is novel of its kind within the region, in such a way to expose channels for further research expansion and innovation within BMI for rehabilitation applications. Furthermore, it will facilitate channels of collaboration for engineering, computer science, and algorithms for medical rehab application.
