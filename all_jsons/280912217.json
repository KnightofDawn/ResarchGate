Despite the compactness of this model and, more importantly, the arbitrary nature of the form-function relationship in language, our \"composed\" word representations yield state-of-the-art results in language modeling and part-of-speech tagging. Benefits over traditional baselines are particularly pronounced in morphologically rich languages (e.g., Turkish)."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49747976_Rules_representations_and_the_English_past_tense", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221629033_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_from_97_to_100_Is_It_Time_for_Some_Linguistics", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2934696_The_Annotation_Process_in_the_Turkish_Treebank", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220946912_Semi-Supervised_Training_for_the_Averaged_Perceptron_POS_Tagger", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280773308_Improved_Transition-Based_Parsing_by_Modeling_Characters_instead_of_Words_with_LSTMs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3703274_Scalable_backoff_language_models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2558879_Foresta_Sintfictica_A_treebank_for_Portuguese", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270877588_Gathering_and_Generating_Paraphrases_from_Twitter_with_Application_to_Normalization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2348437_Entropy-based_Pruning_of_Backoff_Language_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013210_Less_is_More_Significance-Based_N-gram_Selection_for_Smaller_Better_Language_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220706860_Unknown_Word_Guessing_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Support_Vector_Machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50235557_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228981212_Semisupervised_condensed_nearest_neighbor_for_part-of-speech_tagging", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270878536_Better_Word_Representations_with_Recursive_Neural_Networks_for_Morphology", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273067722_When_Are_Tree_Structures_Necessary_for_Deep_Learning_of_Representations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262171612_Entropy-based_pruning_for_phrase-based_machine_translation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7647316_Schmidhuber_J_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures_Neural_Netw_185--6_602-610", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228878883_Automatic_transliteration_and_back-transliteration_by_decision_tree_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268748094_Structure_Regularization_for_Structured_Prediction_Theories_and_Experiments", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262403819_A_systematic_comparison_of_phrase_table_pruning_techniques", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262416331_Compositional_Morphology_for_Word_Representations_and_Language_Modelling", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270878065_A_Recursive_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation"]}
