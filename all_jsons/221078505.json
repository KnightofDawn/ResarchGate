Thereby, we extract from each video action at each timestep a set of features which describe both the visual content (by the mean of a BoW ap- proach) and the dominant motion (with a key point based approach). A Long Short-Term Memory-based Recurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each video sequence considering the temporal evo- lution of the features for each timestep. Experimental results on the MICC-Soccer-Actions-4 database show that the proposed approach out- performs classification methods of related works (with a classification rate of 77 %), and that the combination of the two features (BoW and dominant motion) leads to a classification rate of 92 %."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2550106_Automatic_Soccer_Video_Analysis_and_Summarization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3621596_Automatic_passing_of_TV_soccer_program", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320057_Learning_Precise_Timing_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038910_Lowe_DG_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Key-points_Int_J_Comput_Vision_602_91-110", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215458581_Random_Sample_Consensus_A_Paradigm_for_Model_Fitting_with_Applications_To_Image_Analysis_and_Automated_Cartography", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210113104_Action_Categorization_in_Soccer_Videos_Using_String_Kernels", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5613899_Automatic_Soccer_Video_Analysis_and_Summarization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2534318_Text_Localization_Enhancement_and_Binarization_in_Multimedia_Documents", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200033861_Neural_Networks_for_Pattern_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition"]}
