In principle, the proposed method is applicable to any kind of steganography at any domain. Special interest is put on the steganalysis of Highly Undetectable Steganography (HUGO). The proposed method first extracts features via applying a function to the image, constructing the k variate probability density function (PDF) estimates, and downsampling it by a suitable downsampling algorithm. The extracted feature vectors are then further optimized in order to increase the detection performance and reduce the computational time. Finally using a supervised classification algorithm such as SVM, steganalysis is performed. The proposed method is capable of detecting BOSSRank image set with an accuracy of 85%."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2534088_Practical_Steganalysis_of_Digital_Images_-_State_of_the_Art", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3343565_Steganalytic_Features_for_JPEG_Compression-Based_Perturbed_Quantization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40653276_Steganalysis_by_Subtractive_Pixel_Adjacency_Matrix", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221521415_Blind_Statistical_Steganalysis_of_Additive_Steganography_Using_Wavelet_Higher_Order_Statistics", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3338654_Detecting_LSB_steganography_in_color_and_gray-scale_images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224113758_SVD-Based_Universal_Spatial_Domain_Image_Steganalysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222276857_Floating_Search_Methods_in_Feature_Selection", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280964412_An_information-theoretic_model_for_steganography", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722273_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
