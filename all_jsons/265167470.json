A first level feature vector is extracted and then a high level representation is obtained by taking advantage of a Deep Belief Network trained using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. The classification is finally performed by a feed-forward neural network. The main advantage behind the proposed approach lies in the fact that the high level representation is automatically built by the system exploiting the regularities in the dataset; given a suitably large dataset, it can be expected that such a representation can outperform a hand-design description scheme. The proposed approach has been tested on two standard datasets and the achieved results, compared with state of the art algorithms, confirm its effectiveness.
