Dellana"}, "abstract": "This paper describes a novel framework for context-based object-recognition/pose-estimation. High-level geometric constraints are used to optimize fitting of a 3d model to a 2d image through a process termed \"back-projective priming\". A practical problem in robotics, electrical outlet discovery, is used for testing. The robot, experimental setup, and ongoing/future work are described."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6144516_Nontarget_objects_can_influence_perceptual_processes_during_object_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11298228_The_Spatiotemporal_Dynamics_of_Illusory_Contour_Processing_Combined_High-Density_Electrical_Mapping_Source_Analysis_and_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236224317_Top-down_influences_on_visual_processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263091712_Deep_Neural_Networks_Rival_the_Representation_of_Primate_IT_Cortex_for_Core_Visual_Object_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221076655_Autonomous_Door_Opening_and_Plugging_In_with_a_Personal_Robot"]}
