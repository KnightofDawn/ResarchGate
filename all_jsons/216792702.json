An energy-based model associates a scalar energy to config- urations of inputs, outputs, and latent variables. Infer- ence consists in finding configurations of output and la- tent variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding parameters that minimize a suitable loss func- tion so that the module produces lower energies for \"cor- rect\" outputs than for all \"incorrect\" outputs. Learning machines can be constructed by assembling modules and loss functions. Gradient-based learning procedures are easily implemented through semi-automatic differentiati on of complex models constructed by assembling predefined modules. We introduce an open-source and cross-platform C++ library called EBLearn 1 to enable the construction of energy-based learning models. EBLearn is composed of two major components, libidx: an efficient and very flex- ible multi-dimensional tensor library, andlibeblearn: an object-oriented library of trainable modules and learning algorithms. The latter has facilities for such models as con - volutional networks, as well as for image processing. It als o provides graphical display functions.
