Calliess", "2": "Geoffrey J. Gordon"}, "abstract": "We develop a novel mechanism for coordinated, distributed multiagent planning. We consider problems stated as a col- lection of single-agent planning problems coupled by com- mon soft constraints on resource consumption. (Resources may be real or fictitious, the latter introduced as a tool for factoring the problem). A key idea is to recast the dis- tributed planning problem as learning in a repeated game between the original agents and a newly introduced group of adversarial agents who influence prices for the resources. The adversarial agents benefit from arbitrage: that is, their incentive is to uncover violations of the resource usage con- straints and, by selfishly adjusting prices, encourage the original agents to avoid plans that cause such violations. If all agents employ no-regret learning algorithms in the course of this repeated interaction, we are able to show that our mechanism can achieve design goals such as social op- timality (efficiency), budget balance, and Nash-equilibrium convergence to within an error which approaches zero as the agents gain experience. In particular, the agents' average plans converge to a socially optimal solution for the original planning task. We present experiments in a simulated net- work routing domain demonstrating our method's ability to reliably generate sound plans."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1960980_A_Market-Oriented_Programming_Environment_and_its_Application_to_Distributed_Multicommodity_Flow_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2891793_A_BGP-based_Mechanism_for_Lowest-Cost_Routing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222581798_Sharing_the_Cost_of_Multicast_Transmissions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221343857_Routing_without_regret_On_convergence_to_Nash_equilibria_of_regret-minimizing_algorithms_in_routing_games", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344458_Auction-Based_Multi-Robot_Routing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221454733_Reinforcement_learning_with_utility-aware_agents_for_market-based_resource_allocation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695781_Learning_correlated_equilibria_in_games_with_compact_sets_of_strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2877449_Online_Oblivious_Routing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2428237_Game_Theory_On-line_Prediction_and_Boosting", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2468322_A_Free_Market_Architecture_for_Coordinating_Multiple_Robots", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2899356_Market-based_Approaches_for_Coordination_of_Multi-robot_Teams_at_Different_Granularities_of_Interaction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3032582_Convex_Optimization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221454352_Experiments_with_Planning_and_Markets_in_Multiagent_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234054485_Distributed_Planning_in_Hierarchical_Factored_MDPs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344757_No-regret_learning_in_convex_games", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2885544_Online_Convex_Programming_and_Generalized_Infinitesimal_Gradient_Ascent", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2519092_Regret_Bounds_for_Prediction_Problems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3299269_Sold_Auction_methods_for_multirobot_coordination", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221591118_Regret_minimization_and_the_price_of_total_anarchy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220693560_Selfish_Routing_and_The_Price_of_Anarchy"]}
