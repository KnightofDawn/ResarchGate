This thesis gives a unified view of the abstract problem and presents some models and algorithms for improved sequence recognition and modeling performance, measured on synthetic data and on real speech data. A powerful neural network structure to deal with sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which allows one to estimate P (y t jx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x t ), the output probability distribution at time t given all previous input. The first part of this thesis presents various extensions to the basic RNN structure, which are a) a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN), which allows the estimation of expressions of the form P (y t jx T 1 ), the out...
