At least part of these differences might be due to the fact that fish are usually trained with only one or two dozen trials while extensive training, sometimes with thousands of trials, is normally performed in studies of mammals and birds. To test this hypothesis, female guppies were trained on four consecutive numerical discriminations of increasing difficulty (from 2 vs. 3 to 5 vs. 6 items), with up to 120 trials with each discrimination. Five out of eight subjects discriminated all contrasts up to 4 vs. 5 objects at levels significantly better than chance, a much higher limit than the 2 vs. 3 limit previously reported in studies that provided fish with only short training sequences. Our findings indicate that the difference in numerical cognition between teleosts and warm blooded vertebrates might be smaller than previously supposed."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221885791_A_new_training_procedure_for_studying_discrimination_learning_in_fish", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261831556_Spontaneous_versus_trained_numerical_abilities_A_comparison_between_the_two_main_tools_to_study_numerical_competence_in_non-human_animals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31941471_Gauthier_I_Skudlarski_P_Gore_JC_Anderson_AW_Expertise_for_cars_and_birds_recruits_brain_areas_involved_in_face_recognition_Nat_Neurosci_3_191-197", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51630611_Small_and_large_number_discrimination_in_guppies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26286447_Spontaneous_number_representation_in_mosquitofish", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23172174_The_discrimination_of_discrete_and_continuous_amounts_in_African_grey_parrots_Psittacus_erithacus", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5605285_Do_fish_count_Spontaneous_discrimination_of_quantity_in_female_mosquitofish", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5240661_Adaptive_numerical_competency_in_a_food-hoarding_songbird", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232537460_Can_a_Pigeon_Simultaneously_Process_Temporal_and_Numerical_Information", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49637296_Number_versus_continuous_quantity_in_numerosity_judgments_by_fish", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12499143_Spontaneous_number_representation_in_semi-free-ranging_rhesus_monkeys", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233421505_Inter-Specific_Differences_in_Numerical_Abilities_Among_Teleost_Fish"]}
