Research on crater detection algorithms (CDAs) of the Moon and other planetary bodies has concentrated on detecting them from imagery data, but the computational cost of detecting large craters using images makes these CDAs impractical. This paper presents a new approach to crater detection that utilizes a digital elevation model instead of images; this enables fully automatic global detection of large craters. Craters were delineated by terrain attributes, and then thresholding maps of terrain attributes were used to transform topographic data into a binary image, finally craters were detected by using the Hough Transform from the binary image. By using the proposed algorithm, we produced a catalog of all craters \u2a7e10 km in diameter on the lunar surface and analyzed their distribution and population characteristics."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226203722_Laser_altimetry_data_of_Chang'E-1_and_the_global_lunar_DEM_model", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252204087_A_new_crater_recognition_method_and_its_applications_to_images_of_Mars", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234196314_A_Global_Catalog_of_Large_Lunar_Craters_20_km_from_the_Lunar_Orbiter_Laser_Altimeter", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234289410_Automatic_Recognition_of_Crater-like_Structures_in_Terrestrial_and_Planetary_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220833468_Mining_of_Topographic_Feature_from_Heterogeneous_Imagery_and_Its_Application_to_Lunar_Craters", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46288439_Global_Distribution_of_Large_Lunar_Craters_Implications_for_Resurfacing_and_Impactor_Populations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223791005_Automated_detection_and_classification_of_lunar_craters_using_multiple_approaches", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227027086_Automated_detection_of_lunar_craters_based_on_object-oriented_approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230726824_Automatic_extraction_of_lunar_impact_craters_from_Chang'E-1_satellite_photographs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3204339_Machine_Detection_of_Martian_Impact_Craters_From_Digital_Topography_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224789207_Cratering_Records_in_the_Inner_Solar_System_in_Relation_to_the_Lunar_Reference_System", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252585341_Automated_Identification_of_Martian_Craters_Using_Image_Processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224110977_Method_for_Crater_Detection_From_Martian_Digital_Topography_Data_Using_Gradient_ValueOrientation_Morphometry_Vote_Analysis_Slip_Tuning_and_Calibration", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222777744_Coordinate_registration_by_automated_crater_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32894015_Automated_Crater_Detection_A_New_Tool_for_Mars_Cartography_and_Chronology", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238539857_Automatic_Detection_of_Sub-km_Craters_Using_Shape_and_Texture_Information", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234149048_The_importance_of_secondary_cratering_to_age_constraints_on_planetary_surface", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225925554_A_study_of_lunar_impact_crater_size-distributions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257684587_Primary_scientific_results_of_Chang'E-1_lunar_mission", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253429785_The_Comparison_of_Size-Frequency_Distributions_of_Impact_Craters_and_Asteroids_and_the_Planetary_Cratering_Rate", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241624693_Automated_detection_of_lunar_craters_based_on_Chang'E-1_CCD_data"]}
