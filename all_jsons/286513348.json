The dataset consists of 7702 questions about 294 movies with high semantic diversity. The questions range from simpler \"Who\" did \"What\" to \"Whom\", to \"Why\" and \"How\" certain events occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers; a correct one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators. Our dataset is unique in that it contains multiple sources of information -- full-length movies, plots, subtitles, scripts and for a subset DVS. We analyze our data through various statistics and intelligent baselines. We further extend existing QA techniques to show that question-answering with such open-ended semantics is hard. We plan to create a benchmark with an active leader board, to encourage inspiring work in this challenging domain.
