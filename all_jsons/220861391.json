ICDAR 2009. This competition is based on the RIMES-database, with French written text documents. These document are classified in three different categories, complete text pages, words, and isolated characters. This year 10 systems were submitted for the handwritten recogni- tion competition on snippets of French words. The systems were evaluated in three subtask depending of the sizes of the used dictionary. A comparison between different classi- fication and recognition systems show interesting results. A short description of the participating groups, their systems, and the results achieved are presented."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252051170_RIMES_evaluation_campaign_for_handwritten_mail_processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224671555_Sophisticated_topology_of_hidden_Markov_models_for_cursive_script_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249032122_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192989_An_omnifont_open-vocabulary_OCR_system_for_English_and_Arabic", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220927535_Multi-script_handwriting_recognition_with_N-streams_low_level_features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224273337_A_neural_network-hidden_Markov_model_hybrid_for_cursive_word_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220860565_Results_of_the_RIMES_Evaluation_Campaign_for_Handwritten_Mail_Processing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220860355_A_Multi-stream_Approach_to_Off-Line_Handwritten_Word_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4033409_Model_length_adaptation_of_an_HMM_based_cursive_word_recognition_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3602541_Preprocessing_and_feature_extraction_for_a_handwriting_recognition_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36419563_Supervised_Sequence_Labelling_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225570075_Cross-learning_in_Analytic_Word_Recognition_Without_Segmentation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4288363_Dynamic_handwritten_keyword_spotting_based_on_the_NSHP-HMM", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24428970_Combining_Slanted-Frame_Classifiers_for_Improved_HMM-Based_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29618437_Base_de_donnees_et_competitions_-_Outils_de_developpement_et_d'evaluation_de_systemes_de_reconnaissance_de_mots_manuscrits_arabes"]}
