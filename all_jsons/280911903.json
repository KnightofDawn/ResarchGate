Wilber", "2": "Nicolas Savva"}, "abstract": "We examine the possibility that recent promising results in automatic caption generation are due primarily to language models. By varying image representation quality produced by a convolutional neural network, we find that a state-of-the-art neural captioning algorithm is able to produce quality captions even when provided with surprisingly poor image representations. We replicate this result in a new, fine-grained, transfer learned captioning domain, consisting of 66K recipe image/title pairs. We also provide some experiments regarding the appropriateness of datasets for automatic captioning, and find that having multiple captions per image is beneficial, but not an absolute requirement."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2709366_Learning_Many_Related_Tasks_at_the_Same_Time_With_Backpropagation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221128340_PFID_Pittsburgh_fast-food_image_dataset", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270878844_Meteor_Universal_Language_Specific_Translation_Evaluation_for_Any_Target_Language", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268525836_Long-term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition_and_Description", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268525230_From_Captions_to_Visual_Concepts_and_Back", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221303952_Every_Picture_Tells_a_Story_Generating_Sentences_from_Images", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221578512_Lossless_Compression_Based_on_the_Sequence_Memoizer", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262256563_Framing_Image_Description_as_a_Ranking_Task_Data_Models_and_Evaluation_Metrics", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269339562_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268155634_Unifying_Visual-Semantic_Embeddings_with_Multimodal_Neural_Language_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273158321_What's_Cookin'_Interpreting_Cooking_Videos_using_Text_Speech_and_Vision", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266560687_Explain_Images_with_Multimodal_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260302048_Im2Text_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2588204_BLEU_a_Method_for_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Machine_Translation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345823_Generating_Text_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268689555_CIDEr_Consensus-based_Image_Description_Evaluation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268451983_Show_and_Tell_A_Neural_Image_Caption_Generator", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345224_A_stochastic_memoizer_for_sequence_data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362578_Food_recognition_using_statistics_of_pairwise_local_features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268079628_How_transferable_are_features_in_deep_neural_networks"]}
