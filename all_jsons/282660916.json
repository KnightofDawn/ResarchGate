Such recognition systems are deployed to serve as a replacement for the commonly used human-machine interactive devices such as keyboard, mouse, joystick etc. in real world situations. The major challenges faced by a vision based hand gesture recognition system include recognition in complex background, in dynamic background, in presence of multiple gestures in the background, under variable lighting condition, under different viewpoints etc. In the context of sign language recognition, which is a highly demanding application of hand gesture recognition system, coarticulation detection is a challenging task. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a general overview of vision based hand gesture recognition system as well as to bring into light some of the research works that have been done in this field.
