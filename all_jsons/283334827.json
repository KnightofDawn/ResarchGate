A recurrent neural network is trained to predict the position of an object in the video at time t+1 given a series of selective glimpses at times 1 to t. Glimpses are selected based on a differentiable (soft-)attention mechanism, which makes it possible to train the model end-to-end using standard stochastic gradient descent. Experiments on artificial data-sets show the importance of various design choices and show that the model is able to perform simple tracking tasks."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233753224_Theano_new_features_and_speed_improvements", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224283323_Learning_Where_to_Attend_with_Deep_Architectures_for_Image_Tracking", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232632415_Pedestrian_detection_A_benchmark", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51539292_Pedestrian_Detection_An_Evaluation_of_the_State_of_the_Art", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_Challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15829465_Fukushima_K_Neocognitron_A_self-organizing_neural_network_model_for_a_mechanism_of_pattern_recognition_unaffected_by_shift_in_position_Biol_Cybern_36_193-202", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272422583_DRAW_A_Recurrent_Neural_Network_For_Image_Generation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors_arXiv_preprint_arXiv12070580", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274645044_A_Simple_Way_to_Initialize_Recurrent_Networks_of_Rectified_Linear_Units", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263390366_Recurrent_Models_of_Visual_Attention", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281487270_A_Neural_Attention_Model_for_Abstractive_Sentence_Summarization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194766_Show_Attend_and_Tell_Neural_Image_Caption_Generation_with_Visual_Attention"]}
