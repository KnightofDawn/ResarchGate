To address this problem, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) researchers have developed a large number of encoding and decoding methods. However, previous studies typically used rather limited stimuli representation, like semantic labels and Wavelet Gabor filters, and largely focused on voxel-based brain patterns. Here, we present a new fMRI encoding model to predict the human brain's responses to free viewing of video clips which aims to deal with this limitation. In this model, we represent the stimuli using a variety of representative visual features in the computer vision community, which can describe the global color distribution, local shape and spatial information and motion information contained in videos, and apply the functional connectivity to model the brain's activity pattern evoked by these video clips. Our experimental results demonstrate that brain network responses during free viewing of videos can be robustly and accurately predicted across subjects by using visual features. Our study suggests the feasibility of exploring cognitive neuroscience studies by computational image/video analysis and provides a novel concept of using the brain encoding as a test-bed for evaluating visual feature extraction.
