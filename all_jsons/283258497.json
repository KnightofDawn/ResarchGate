The method is applied on naturalistic functional MRI (fMRI) images acquired during task-free continuous music listening experiment, and the results are compared with the outcome of the conventional GICA. The extended GICA resulted slightly faster ICA convergence and, more interestingly, extracted more stimulus-related components than its conventional counterpart. Therefore, we think the extension is beneficial enhancement for GICA, especially when applied to challenging fMRI data."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23626427_A_review_of_group_ICA_for_fMRI_data_and_ICA_for_joint_inference_of_imaging_genetic_and_ERP_data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23456070_Who_Is_Saying_What_Brain-Based_Decoding_of_Human_Voice_and_Speech", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5367870_Intersubject_Synchronization_of_Cortical_Activity_during_Natural_Vision", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5530825_Kay_K_N_et_al_Identifying_natural_images_from_human_brain_activity_Nature_452_352-355", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243776847_A_Method_for_Making_Group_Inferences_Using_Independent_Component_Analysis_of_Functional_MRI_Data_Exploring_the_Visual_System", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7532949_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Generating_Group_Statistical_Inferences_from_Independent_Component_Analysis_of_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229057967_Relations_Between_Two_Sets_of_Variates", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31058102_Canonical_Analysis_of_Several_Sets_of_Variables", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261090343_A_generalized_canonical_correlation_analysis_based_method_for_blind_source_separation_from_related_data_sets", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234066156_Fast_and_Effective_Model_Order_Selection_Method_to_Determine_the_Number_of_Sources_in_a_Linear_Transformation_Model"]}
