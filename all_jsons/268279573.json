This is due to market demand and enabled by reduction in costs of robot systems. If robots can be introduced strategically in existing production workflows, productivity could be increased. However, the task division and interaction between human and robot co-workers need to be optimized in order to achieve this. This work-in-progress paper presents a pilot setup to explore such scenarios. We discuss early findings and we present our vision for the future of human robot coproduction."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261847450_Comparative_performance_of_human_and_mobile_robotic_assistants_in_collaborative_fetch-and-deliver_tasks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200498599_Robotic_Home_Assistant_Care-O-bot_3_-_Product_Vision_and_Innovation_Platform", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262405053_Personalizing_robot_tutors_to_individuals'_learning_differences", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262156274_Teaching_people_how_to_teach_robots_The_effect_of_instructional_materials_and_dialog_design", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261132541_Programming_concept_for_an_industrial_HRI_packaging_cell", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221473232_Improved_human-robot_team_performance_using_Chaski_a_human-inspired_plan_execution_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235722181_Towards_Easier_Human-Robot_Interaction_to_Help_Inexperienced_Operators_in_SMEs"]}
