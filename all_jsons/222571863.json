Knowing the positions of one\u2019s head and eyes, for example, one can compute the body-centred position of an object from its perceived coordinates on the retinae. We propose a simple and fully trained attractor network which computes head-centred coordinates given eye position and a perceived retinal object position. We demonstrate this system on artificial data and then apply it within a fully neurally implemented control system which visually guides a simulated robot to a table for grasping an object. The integrated system has as input a primitive visual system with a what\u2013where pathway which localises the target object in the visual field. The coordinate transform network considers the visually perceived object position and the camera pan-tilt angle and computes the target position in a body-centred frame of reference. This position is used by a reinforcement-trained network to dock a simulated PeopleBot robot at a table for reaching the object. Hence, neurally computing coordinate transformations by an attractor network has biological relevance and technical use for this important class of computations."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11418984_Direct_visuomotor_transformations_for_reaching", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11866221_Efficient_computation_and_cue_integration_with_noisy_population_codes", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222630633_Three_Dimensional_Frames_of_References_Transformations_using_Recurrent_Populations_of_Neurons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37425179_View_Sensitive_Cells_as_a_Neural_Basis_for_the_Representation_of_Others_in_a_Self-Centered_Frame_of_Reference", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222545385_Robot_Docking_with_Neural_Vision_and_Reinforcement", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2240722_Generalization_to_Local_Remappings_of_the_Visuomotor_Coordinate_Transformation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12976761_Dynamic_representation_of_eye_position_in_the_parieto-occipital_sulcus", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2365327_Biologically_Plausible_Error-Driven_Learning_Using_Local_Activation_Differences_The_Generalized_Recirculation_Algorithm", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224656674_Learning_algorithms_for_Boltzmann_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10591432_Dynamic_synchronization_and_chaos_in_an_associative_neural_network_with_multiple_active_memories", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14381696_Generalization_to_remappings_of_the_visuomotor_coordinate_transformation_J_Neurosci_167085-7096", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10934069_Basis_Functions_for_Object-Centered_Representations", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744578_A_Learning_algorithm_for_Boltzmann_machines", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10847092_Posterior_parietal_cortex_and_the_filtering_of_distractors", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11282011_A_Common_Reference_Frame_for_Movement_Plans_in_the_Posterior_Parietal_Cortex", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220552399_Computation_with_populations_codes_in_layered_networks_of_integrate-and-fire_neurons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228989406_A_developmental_approach_to_grasping", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8496680_Spatial_transformations_for_eye-hand_coordination", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222451035_A_Learning_Algorithm_for_Boltzmann_Machines"]}
