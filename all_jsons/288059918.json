Recent methods such as MultiBox, YOLO and RPN use a single neural net evaluation to hypothesize promising object locations. While these approaches are computationally efficient, they rely on fixed image regions as anchors for predictions. In this paper we propose to use a search strategy that adaptively directs computational resources to sub-regions likely to contain objects. Compared to methods based on fixed anchor locations, our approach naturally adapts to cases where object instances are sparse and small. Our approach is comparable in terms of accuracy to the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN approach while using two orders of magnitude fewer anchors on average.
