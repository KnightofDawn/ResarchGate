The ELM paradigm is a fast and accurate learning alternative for single layer Feedforward networks. We experiment on the acted facial expressions in the wild corpus, which features seven discrete emotions, and adhere to the EmotiW 2014 challenge protocols. In our study, better results for both modalities are obtained with kernel ELM compared to basic ELM. We contrast several fusion approaches and reach a test set accuracy of 50.12 % (over a video-only baseline of 33.70 %) on the seven-class (i.e. six basic emotions plus neutral) EmotiW 2014 Challenge, by combining one audio and three video sub-systems. We also compare ELM with partial least squares regression based classification that is used in the top performing system of EmotiW 2014, and discuss the advantages of both approaches."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220656409_Geometric_Means_in_a_Novel_Vector_Space_Structure_on_Sysmetric_Positive-Definite_Matrices", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23631413_Multivariate_Normal_Distributions_Parametrized_as_a_Riemannian_Symmetric_Space", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7641976_Feature_Selection_Based_On_Mutual_Information_Criteria_of_Max-DependencyMax-Relevance_and_Min-Redundancy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266654707_Partial_least_squares_regression_on_Grassmannian_manifold_for_emotion_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929655_openSMILE_--_The_Munich_Versatile_and_Fast_Open-Source_Audio_Feature_Extractor", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220578095_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machine_Classifiers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8204636_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_An_Overview_with_Application_to_Learning_Methods", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261206959_Local_Gabor_Binary_Patterns_from_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221491017_A_database_of_German_emotional_speech", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259889921_The_INTERSPEECH_2013_computational_paralinguistics_challenge_Social_signals_conflict_emotion_autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232638637_Cross-Corpus_Acoustic_Emotion_Recognition_Variances_and_Strategies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256575180_Collecting_Large_Richly_Annotated_Facial-Expression_Databases_from_Movies", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221481381_The_INTERSPEECH_2010_paralinguistic_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262313360_Emotion_Recognition_In_The_Wild_Challenge_2013", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24061088_Note_on_the_Sampling_Error_of_the_Difference_Between_Correlated_Proportions_or_Percentages", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221936069_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100829_CCA_based_feature_selection_with_application_to_continuous_depression_recognition_from_acoustic_speech_features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346037_Grassman_Discriminant_Analysis_a_Unifying_View_on_Subspace-Based_learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100662_Random_Discriminative_Projection_Based_Feature_Selection_with_Application_to_Conflict_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100765_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_and_Local_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis_based_Multi-View_Acoustic_Feature_Reduction_for_Physical_Load_Prediction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262165643_Combining_modality_specific_deep_neural_networks_for_emotion_recognition_in_video", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4238264_The_eNTERFACE05_Audio-Visual_Emotion_Database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51704039_Extreme_learning_machine_for_regression_and_multiclass_classification_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_422_513-529", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929562_Voice_and_Speech_Analysis_in_Search_of_States_and_Traits", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261502521_Covariance_discriminative_learning_A_natural_and_efficient_approach_to_image_set_classification", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243780258_Line_Spectrum_Representation_of_Linear_Predictor_Coefficients_of_Speech_Signals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222667300_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267213794_Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Using_Deep_Neural_Network_and_Extreme_Learning_Machine", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269100725_Combining_Modality-Specific_Extreme_Learning_Machines_for_Emotion_Recognition_in_the_Wild", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038910_Lowe_DG_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Key-points_Int_J_Comput_Vision_602_91-110", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4116697_Extreme_learning_machine_A_new_learning_scheme_of_feedforward_neural_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259399116_Kernel_Learning_for_Extrinsic_Classification_of_Manifold_Features"]}
