It is an integral part of the annual ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). In 2007, the traditional KDD Cup competition was augmented with a workshop with a focus on the concurrently active Netflix Prize competition [2]. The KDD Cup itself in 2007 consisted of a prediction competition using Netflix movie rating data, with tasks that were different and separate from those being used in the Netflix Prize itself. At the workshop, participants in both the KDD Cup and the Netflix Prize competition presented their results and analyses, and exchanged ideas.
