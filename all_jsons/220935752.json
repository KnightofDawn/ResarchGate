To provide better classification of craters in planetary images, feature subset selection is used to reduce irrelevant and redundant features. Feature selection is known to be NP-hard. To provide an efficient suboptimal solution, three genetic algorithms are proposed to use greedy selection, weighted random selection, and simulated annealing to distinguish discriminate features from indiscriminate features. A significant increase in the classification ability of a Bayesian classifier in crater detection using image texture features.
