Aditya Prakash"}, "abstract": "Given a motion capture sequence, how to identify the category of the motion? Classifying human motions is a critical task in motion editing and synthesizing, for which manual labeling is clearly inefficient for large databases. Here we study the general problem of time series clustering. We propose a novel method of clustering time series that can (a) learn joint temporal dynamics in the data; (b) handle time lags; and (c) produce interpretable features. We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advantage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one easier to interpret. We then present Complex-Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the parameters for the general model and its special case for clustering. Our approach produces significant improvement in clustering quality, 1.5 to 5 times better than well-known competitors on real motion capture sequences."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224336482_A_complex_gradient_operator_and_its_application_in_adaptive_array_theory", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224461235_Widely-linear_recursive_least-squares_algorithm_for_adaptive_beamforming", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2946617_K-Means_Clustering_Via_Principal_Component_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246695420_Linear_and_Graphical_Models_For_the_Multivariate_Complex_Normal_Distribution", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38366196_Statistical_Analysis_Based_on_a_Certain_Multivariate_Complex_Gaussian_Distribution_An_Introduction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4090337_Extraction_and_clustering_of_motion_trajectories_in_video", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221213566_Time_Series_Similarity_Measures_and_Time_Series_Indexing", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2341699_Parameter_Estimation_for_Linear_Dynamical_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234804842_Scaling_and_time_warping_in_time_series_querying", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221310200_Scaling_and_Time_Warping_in_Time_Series_Querying", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4028653_Measurement_and_comparison_of_human_and_humanoid_walking", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220538603_Parsimonious_Linear_Fingerprinting_for_Time_Series", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224440197_Adaptive_IIR_Filtering_of_Noncircular_Complex_Signals"]}
