Magnitude spectrum has been a dominant feature over the years. Although perceptual studies have shown that phase spectrum is essential to the quality of synthesized speech, it is often ignored by using a minimum phase filter during synthesis and the speech quality suffers. To bypass this bottleneck in vocoded speech, this paper proposes a phase-embedded waveform representation framework and establishes a magnitude-phase joint modeling platform for high-quality SPSS. Our experiments on waveform reconstruction show that the performance is better than that of the widely-used STRAIGHT. Furthermore, the proposed modeling and synthesis platform outperforms a leading-edge, vocoded, deep bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network (DBLSTM-RNN)-based baseline system in various objective evaluation metrics conducted."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221484594_Simultaneous_Modeling_Of_Spectrum_Pitch_And_Duration_In_HMM-Based_Speech_Synthesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222428447_Statistical_Parametric_Speech_Synthesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261230379_Statistical_parametric_speech_synthesis_using_deep_neural_networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/208033242_The_Acoustic_Theory_of_Speech_Production_Mouton_The_Hague", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266377302_Investigating_source_and_filter_contributions_and_their_interaction_to_statistical_parametric_speech_synthesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247049931_On_the_use_of_a_sinusoidal_model_for_speech_synthesis_in_text-to-speech", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245525030_The_effect_of_group_delay_spectrum_on_timbre", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224175095_Phase_Minimization_for_Glottal_Model_Estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222691365_Iterative_reconstruction_of_speech_from_short-time_Fourier_transform_phase_and_magnitude_spectra", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3908320_Using_phase_spectrum_information_for_improved_speech_recognition_performance", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3457634_On_the_importance_of_phase_in_human_speech_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10593962_Squared_error_as_a_measure_of_perceived_phase_distortion", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221481194_Dominance_spectrum_based_VUV_classification_and_F0_estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29453115_USEFULNESS_OF_PHASE_SPECTRUM_IN_HUMAN_SPEECH_PERCEPTION", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263465051_The_Importance_of_Phase_on_Voice_Quality_Assessment", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220121138_Pitch-synchronous_waveform_processing_techniques_for_text-to-speech_synthesis_using_diphones", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222473076_MBR-PSOLA_Text-To-Speech_synthesis_based_on_an_MBE_re-synthesis_of_the_segments_database", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261499557_Complex_cepstrum_as_phase_information_in_statistical_parametric_speech_synthesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333406_Determination_of_Instants_of_Significant_Excitation_in_Speech_Using_Group_Delay_Function", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260692539_Modeling_Spectral_Envelopes_Using_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_and_Deep_Belief_Networks_for_Statistical_Parametric_Speech_Synthesis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221487718_Glottal_closure_and_opening_instant_detection_from_speech_signals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220655974_Detection_of_Glottal_Closure_Instants_From_Speech_Signals_A_Quantitative_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36419563_Supervised_Sequence_Labelling_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258818168_Speech_Recognition_with_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224738883_Line_Spectrum_Pair_LSP_and_Speech_Data_Compression", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243780258_Line_Spectrum_Representation_of_Linear_Predictor_Coefficients_of_Speech_Signals", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224312975_Tandem-STRAIGHT_A_temporally_stable_power_spectral_representation_for_periodic_signals_and_applications_to_interference-free_spectrum_F0_and_aperiodicity_estimation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260799313_Harmonics_Plus_Noise_Model_Based_Vocoder_for_Statistical_Parametric_Speech_Synthesis"]}
