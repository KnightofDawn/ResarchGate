Martinez", "3": "Alina Voda", "2": "Olivier Sename"}, "abstract": "  ABSTRACT This paper deals with the modeling and the robust control of the next generation of optical disc drives servo-mechanisms. While in many industrial servo-control implementations, the radial and focus loops are considered as decoupled, e.g. DVD drives, this is no longer true for HD-DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD) formats which are more sensitive to opto-mechanical interactions at high frequencies. The impact of such phenomena on the robustness of the servo is evaluated by using experimental data, and an H\u221e controller is designed to reduce the coupling effect, by using a suitable disturbance model into the problem formulation. Simulations using experimental data illustrate the performance improvement of the compensated system despite the parametric uncertainties in mass-production optical disc drives.
