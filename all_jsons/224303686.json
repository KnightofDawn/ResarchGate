We prove several characterizations of correlated equilibria in continuous games which are more analytically tractable than the standard definition and may be of independent interest. Then we use these to construct algorithms for approximating correlated equilibria of polynomial games with arbitrary accuracy, including a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxation algorithms and discretization algorithms.
