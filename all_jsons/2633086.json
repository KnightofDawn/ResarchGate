Baum", "2": "Igor Durdanovic"}, "abstract": "We address the problem of how to reinforcement learn in ultra-complex environments, with huge state spaces, where one must learn to exploit compact structure of the problem domain. The approach we propose is to simulate the evolution of an artificial economy of computer programs. The economy is constructed based on two simple principles so as to assign credit to the individual programs for collaborating on problem solutions. We find empirically that, starting from programs that are random computer code, we are able to evolve systems that solve hard problems. In particular our economy as learned to solve almost all random Blocks World problems with goal stacks 200 blocks high. Competing methods solve such problems only up to goal stacks of at most 8 blocks. Our economy has also learned to unscramble about half a randomly scrambled Rubik's cube, and to solve several among a collection of commercially sold puzzles."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300097_Genetic_Programming--An_Introduction", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243770270_Manifesto_for_an_evolutionary_economics_of_intelligence", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23740436_Evolving_Parallel_Computation", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4980836_Rules_of_Thumb_Versus_Dynamic_Programming", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222491096_Fast_Planning_Through_Planning_Graph_Analysis", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229091441_Genetic_Programming", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222891794_EURISKO_A_program_that_learns_new_heuristics_and_domain_concepts", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12842093_Lenski_RE_Ofria_C_Collier_TC_Adami_C_Genome_complexity_robustness_and_genetic_interactions_in_digital_organisms_Nature_400_661-664", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220142200_Learning_from_delayed_rewards", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247289081_Toward_Code_Evolution_By_Artificial_Economies_Extended_Abstract", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220425437_Gender_Discrimination_in_the_Workplace_A_Literature_Review", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2376258_Relational_Reinforcement_Learning", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2816861_Using_Temporal_Logic_to_Control_Search_in_a_Forward_Chaining_Planner", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24057292_The_Tragedy_of_the_Commons", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2817334_An_Evolutionary_Post_Production_System", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2382898_Finding_Optimal_Solutions_to_Rubik's_Cube_Using_Pattern_Databases", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220423062_Temporal_Difference_Learning_and_TD-Gammon", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343680_Toward_a_Model_of_Intelligence_as_an_Economy_of_Agents", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343894_Learning_to_Perceive_and_Act_by_Trial_and_Error", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243614874_An_Approach_to_the_Synthesis_of_Life", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2465369_Schemas_and_Genetic_Programming", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242355952_Markets_and_computation_agoric_open_systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5596000_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction_Bradford_Book", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220546004_Planning_as_Search_A_Quantitative_Approach", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245316098_An_Economic_Review_of_the_Patent_System", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976359_Implementing_Semantic_Network_Structures_Using_the_Classifier_System", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976460_Escaping_Brittleness_The_Possibilities_of_General--Purpose_Learning_Algorithms_Applied_to_Parallel_Rule-Based_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976520_A_Critical_Review_of_Classifier_Systems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2817250_ZCS_A_zeroth_level_classifier_system", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2807308_Solving_Complex_Planning_Tasks_Through_Extraction_of_Subproblems", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48308782_Learning_to_Perceive_and_Act", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17487257_The_tragedy_of_the_commons_The_population_problem_has_no_technical_solution_it_requires_a_fundamental_extension_in_morality", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262206006_Strongly_Typed_Genetic_Programming"]}
