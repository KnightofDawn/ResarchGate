The Robotics in the treatment of mental disability.", "authors": {"1": "Daniela Conti"}, "abstract": "The Social Assistive Robotics (SAR), is an emerging technology that uses social interactive robotic platforms to assist people with special needs. Fields of application include the care of elderly subjects, patients with dementia or Alzheimer's diseases, cognitive/motor disorders, treatment of post-stroke patients and education of children with disabilities including autism spectrum disorder.  Exploring the recent alliance between the fields of robotic and psychology, the paper deals with various studies on the acceptability of the robotic instrument in different application contexts.  This contribution is concluded with objectives and future trend of development in this young research area."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259127160_Storytelling_by_a_kindergarten_social_assistive_robot_A_tool_for_constructive_learning_in_preschool_education", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259756944_Acceptance_of_socially_assistive_humanoid_robot_by_preschool_and_elementary_school_teachers", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221436849_Measuring_the_influence_of_social_abilities_on_acceptance_of_an_interface_robot_and_a_screen_agent_by_elderly_users", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220757236_How_Social_Robots_Will_Help_Us_to_Diagnose_Treat_and_Understand_Autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220670483_Cross-Cultural_Studies_on_Subjective_Evaluation_of_a_Seal_Robot", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220934162_Playing_with_virtual_peers_Bootstrapping_contingent_discourse_in_children_with_autism", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3972371_Analysis_of_factors_that_bring_mental_effects_to_elderly_people_in_robot_assisted_activity", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4045931_Robot_assisted_activity_to_elderly_at_a_health_service_facility_for_the_aged", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224058529_Trial_of_Using_Robotic_Pet_as_Human_Interface_of_Multimedia_Education_System_for_Pre-school_Aged_Child_in_Kindergarten", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5925527_Children-robot_interaction_a_pilot_study_in_autism_therapy", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245925424_Evaluating_the_Effectiveness_of_Video_Instruction_on_Social_and_Communication_Skills_Training_for_Children_With_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Review_of_the_Literature", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252038889_Humanlike_action_segmentation_for_option_learning"]}
