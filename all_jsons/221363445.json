To solve this problem, several authors have proposed to model each vector set with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and to compute a probabilistic measure of similarity between the GMMs. The main contribution of this paper is to model each vector set with a GMM adapted from a common \"uni- versal\" GMM using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) cri- terion. The advantages of this approach are twofold. MAP provides a more accurate estimate of the GMM parame- ters compared to standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the challenging case where the cardinality of the vector set is small. Moreover, there is a correspondence between the Gaussians of two GMMs adapted from a com- mon distribution and one can take advantage of this fact to compute efficiently the probabilistic similarity. This work is applied to the image categorization problem: images are modeled as bags of low-level features and classification is performed using a kernel classifier based on the proposed similarity measure. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2006 and VOC 2007 databases show the excellent per- formance of our approach."}, "references": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320479_Probability_Product_Kernels", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228602850_Visual_categorization_with_bags_of_keypoints", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333739_Rapid_speaker_adaptation_in_Eigenvoice_space_robust_speech_recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244437609_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_Results", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224744237_Zisserman_A_Video_Google_A_text_retrieval_approach_to_object_matching_in_videos_In_ICCV", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257267653_Gales_M_Maximum_likelihood_linear_transformations_for_HMM-based_speech_recognition_Comput_Speech_Lang_122_75-98", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2869045_A_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence_Based_Kernel_for_SVM_Classification_in_Multimedia_Applications", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221366761_The_2005_PASCAL_visual_object_classes_challenge", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497713_Bhattacharyya_Expected_Likelihood_Kernels", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3085089_On_the_Efficient_Evaluation_of_Probabilistic_Similarity_Functions_for_Image_Retrieval", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038910_Lowe_DG_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Key-points_Int_J_Comput_Vision_602_91-110", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333325_Lee_C_Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation_for_multivariate_Gaussian_mixture_observations_of_Markov_chains_IEEE_Trans_Speech_Audio_Process_2_291-298", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37994127_Approximate_Correspondences_in_High_Dimensions", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222674333_Speaker_Verification_Using_Adapted_Gaussian_Mixture_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333716_Cluster_Adaptive_Training_of_Hidden_Markov_Models", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4193990_The_pyramid_match_kernel_Discriminative_classification_with_sets_of_image_features", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229078317_Woodland_PC_Maximum_likelihood_linear_regression_for_speaker_adaptation_of_continuous_density_hidden_Markov_models_Computer_Speech_and_Language_92_171-185", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2355609_Bilmes_JA_A_Gentle_Tutorial_of_the_EM_Algorithm_and_its_Application_to_Parameter_Estimation_for_Gaussian_Mixture_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_pp_2-7", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304486_Adapted_Vocabularies_for_Generic_Visual_Categorization", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239552097_Local_Features_and_Kernels_for_Classification_of_Texture_and_Object_Categories_An_In-Depth_Study", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225137586_The_Kullback-Leibler_Kernel_as_a_Framework_for_Discriminant_and_Localized_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4038398_An_efficient_image_similarity_measure_based_on_approximations_of_KL-divergence_between_two_gaussian_mixtures"]}
